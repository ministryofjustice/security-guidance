  <title>Handling instructions guidance</title>
  <body>
  <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/hmggovernmentsecurityclassifications"/> outlines HMG's administrative framework to facilitate the secure, timely, and efficient exchange of information. It mandates that all HMG information be marked according to a specific classification tier, and given any required handling instructions.</p>
  <p>This guidance on handling instructions has been developed to aid users in adhering to this requirement, providing examples of how the labelling system and handling descriptors can be applied effectively.</p>

   <title>Handling and securing information</title>
   <body>
    <p>Within a classification tier, handling instructions can also be used to give a more detailed picture of the information's sensitivity and how it should be appropriately handled.</p>
    <p>Handling instructions do not change the information's classification as the threat profile is the same, nor do they offer additional technical protections; they just provide more detail around how information should be handled, how widely it should be disseminated and how it should be protected.</p>
    <p>A centrally defined list of handling instructions is shown in the Additional Markings section of the Government Security Classifications Policy.</p>
    <p>Different information security measures might be applicable throughout the information lifecycle. It is important continually to evaluate security classifications and their corresponding measures. Refer to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/hmggovernmentsecurityclassifications"/> for further guidance.</p>

  <title>Additional markings</title>
  <body>
   <p>Additional markings can be added in conjunction with a classification to indicate the nature or source of the information, or to limit access to specific user groups.</p>
   <p>Additional markings indicate where additional protective controls or security behaviours are required to protect the information. There are several different types of additional markings, including:
   <ul>
    <li>the -SENSITIVE marking</li>
    <li>handling instructions</li>
    <li>descriptors</li>
   </ul></p>
   <p>Information creators should apply additional markings to help users understand information sensitivities and specific restrictions on information sharing.</p>
   <p>Security teams must offer guidance to users on how to mark and protect information with additional markings.</p>
   <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/hmggovernmentsecurityclassifications"/> gives more information about additional markings.</p>
