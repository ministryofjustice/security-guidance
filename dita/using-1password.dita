    <title>What is 1Password?</title>
    <body>
      <p>1Password is an online password management tool that we make available to you to help you create, store and share passwords. Using it means you no longer need to remember dozens of passwords, just a single primary password. It keeps all your website logins protected, helps with creating new 'strong' passwords and password sharing when required.</p>
      <p>1Password is available as a browser extension for popular browsers, as well as a full software suite (for use outside of browsers) for Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS.</p>
      <p>1Password securely saves your credentials in your own 'Vault' and then offers to autofill those credentials the next time you need them.</p>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> has the Business tier of 1Password.</p>

      <p>Contact the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/operationsengineeringteam"/> to request access.</p>
      <p>Make sure you include in your message:
      <ul>
        <li>which team you're in</li>
        <li>your role in your team</li>

      <title>What it can be used for</title>
      <body>
        <p>1Password can be used for sharing passwords within a team, when individual named accounts cannot be created in the service. A good example is running a shared Twitter account.</p>
        <note>If you have a business need for a shared Twitter account, consider using a more enterprise-orientated tool for social media posting, such as <xref href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/" format="html" scope="external">TweetDeck</xref> or <xref href="https://www.hootsuite.com/" format="html" scope="external">Hootsuite</xref>. You need <xref href="general-user-video-and-messaging-apps-guidance.dita" format="dita">formal approval</xref> to use tools like these.</note>

          <p>You <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshouldnot"/> use your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> 1Password account to store personal non-work information as it is a work account belonging to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>. You may lose access if you change role. You will lose access entirely if you leave the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.</p>
          <p>Operations Engineering cannot routinely access the contents of vaults but can reset accounts to gain access if there is a good reason to do so.</p>

          <p>It <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> be at least 14 characters long (the longer the better).</p>
          <p>You can choose to make it pronounceable and memorable (passphrase) such as <codeph>CyberSecurityRules!</codeph> or <codeph>Sup3rD00p3rc0Mp3X!</codeph>, as long as you're comfortable remembering it and won't need to write it down.</p>
          <p>There are password guidance standards <xref href="passwords.dita" format="dita">here</xref>.</p>
          <p>Your primary password <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> be unique and you <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshouldnot"/> use it anywhere else (including a similar version, for example, by simply adding numbers to the end)</p>

        <p>To share a password, create a <xref href="https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults/" format="html" scope="external">Vault</xref>.</p>
        <p>You <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> make sure the credentials you're sharing are only available to the people who need to access them for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> work.

        <p>You <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymustnot"/> share your 1Password main password with anyone, even your line manager or <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> security.</p>

        <p>Taking a device (such as personal smartphone) that has <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> 1Password installed counts as travelling overseas with <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information.</p>
        <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> has existing <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/staff-security-and-responsibilities/travelling-abroad-business-or-personal/" format="html" scope="external">policies on travelling abroad on the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> intranet</xref>, which require various approvals before travel.</p>
        <p>It may be simpler to 'log out' of the 1Password applications or enable <xref href="https://support.1password.com/travel-mode/" format="html" scope="external">Travel Mode</xref> to remove vaults from your devices. These can be reinstated when you return to the UK.</p>

        <p>Like all software, it is important to keep the software up to date (sometimes known as 'patching'). 1Password software generally self-updates to the latest version by itself, however make sure you approve or apply any updates if 1Password asks you to.</p>
