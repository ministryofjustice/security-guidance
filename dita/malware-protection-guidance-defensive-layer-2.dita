      <body>
        <p>This Malware Protection information is mainly intended for in-house <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects, and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.</p>
        <p>Other <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> bodies, agencies, contractors, or IT suppliers and partners who in any way design, develop or supply services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>, will also find this information helpful.</p>

    <title>Defensive Layer 2: Preventing malicious code from being executed</title>
    <body>
      <p>Layer 1 might not always prevent malware from reaching the network. Assume that malware can and will reach <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> devices at some point. The next layer of protection prevents malicious code from taking effect. The tables below outlines ways in which you can help prevent malicious code from executing.</p>
