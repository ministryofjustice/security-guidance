		<p>When working, you need to communicate with <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> colleagues
			and use business tools ('apps').
			You'll also need to work with people outside the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.
			There are various tools you might use, besides the standard email and telephone tools.
			This document tells you about the tools you can, and cannot, use for business purposes.
			This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.</p>
		<p>Some ALBs, Agencies, or other large groups within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> might have their own,
			specific guidance regarding how to use certain  apps for different purposes.</p>

	<topic id="access-to-tools">
		<title>Access to tools</title>
		<body>
			<p>You can access tools that are provided through your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> provided devices by downloading from:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Software Centre application on your device (for Dom1 equipment).</li>
				<li>The Self Service application on your Mac (for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/servicedesk"/> managed MacBook laptops).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Currently, access to the tools mentioned in this document is not available from MoJo devices.</p>
			<p>For other <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> provided devices, seek help from your Line Manager in the first instance.</p>

		<title>Corporate, work and personal accounts</title>
		<body>
			<ul>
				<li>A corporate account is for making official <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> statements and providing official views.
				Only a small number of authorised people can use it.</li>
				<li>A work account is your normal <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> account, that you use every day for business as usual.
				Only you have access to your work account.</li>
				<li>A personal account is your own personal account on gmail, hotmail, yahoo, and so on.
					You should never use a personal account for business purposes.
					To be clear:
					never send your work material to your personal device or your personal email account.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some of the applications listed make a distinction between general use with a work account, and use with a corporate account.
				Using a tool with a corporate account means you are providing views or statements on behalf of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.
				Never use a personal account for business purposes with any tool.</p>
			<p>Remember that if you are authorised to use a corporate account,
				you are speaking and acting for the whole of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.
				When working with a personal account,
				you are speaking and acting as an <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> employee and a civil servant.</p>
			<p>Always follow all <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2015/11/social-media-policy-guidance.pdf" format="pdf" scope="external"><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> policies and guidelines</xref> regarding public information,
			including social media.
			To access this information you'll need to be connected to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Intranet.</p>

		<title>Video conference hardware</title>
		<body>
			<p>There are specific security concerns when using video conferencing hardware. The hardware might need extra permissions, involving access to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> network, or involving personally identifiable information.</p>
			<p>Video conferencing hardware might also be in a 'constant listening state'. This means that anything said within hearing distance, at any time, is 'heard' by the device. Similarly, anything in the line of sight might be 'seen' by the device. Some video conferencing hardware might record and even store the audio or video data outside the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.</p>
			<p>Video conferencing hardware for use within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> meet the required security standards of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>. Any devices that do not meet the security standards <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshallnot"/> be used. The reason is that the hardware might be insecure, and therefore unsafe to use for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official-sensitive"/> conversations.</p>

			<p>The NCSC has excellent guidance on <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/video-conferencing-services-using-them-securely" format="html" scope="external">using video conferencing services safely</xref>.</p>
			<p>Key things to remember <i>before</i> a call include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure your video conferencing account (or the device or app you are using for video conferencing) is protected with a strong password.</li>
				<li>Test the service before making (or joining) your first call.</li>
				<li>Understand what features are available, for example recording the call or sharing files or screen information.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Key things to remember for <i>every</i> call include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not make the calls public, for example always require a password to join the call.</li>
				<li>Know who is joining the call, in particular check that everyone is known and expected to be present,
					and that people who have dialled in have identified themselves clearly and sufficiently.</li>
				<li>Consider your surroundings,
					for example checking what can be seen behind you (forgetting to check information on a whiteboard or noticeboard is an easy mistake).</li>

				<p>Many of the tools are only used for your day-to-day communication with colleagues.
					The information you work with is typically <xref href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications" format="html" scope="external">classified</xref> at <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official"/>.</p>
				<p>Think about the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information you work with when using these tools.
				What would happen if you lost your mobile device, or it's stolen?
				Suppose the voice or video call was overheard in a cafe, or read from your screen on a crowded train.
				Could there be damaging consequences?
				If the answer is 'No', then it's probably OK to use the tool to communicate that information with colleagues.</p>
				<p>You have a duty of confidentiality and a responsibility to safeguard any HMG information or data that you access.
					This is <xref href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications" format="html" scope="external">Principle 2</xref> of the Government Security Classifications.

				<p>Laws and regulations make the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> and its employees responsible for managing information. Some examples include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Freedom of Information Act.</li>
					<li>Data Protection Act and General Data Protection Regulation.</li>
					<li>Public Records Acts.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When we receive a request for information,
					we need to know where we hold all the relevant information.
					Storing business information on appropriate <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> systems helps us, because:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We can provide evidence about decisions.</li>
					<li>We understand the information held, and where to find it.</li>
					<li>We can transfer records to The National Archives.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Always store <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information in <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> systems.
				If you use a tool for work tasks,
				make sure the key information is stored in an appropriate <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system.
				Guidance on what you must keep is available on the Intranet <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/managing-information/keeping-deleting-disclosing-info/" format="html" scope="external">here</xref>.
				At regular and convenient intervals,
				transfer the information to an appropriate <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system.
				Do the same when you finish the work.
				Don't forget to remove any redundant information from a tool by clearing or deleting data if it has been preserved in an <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system.</p>
				<p>Many tools lets you export your data.
					You can then store it on an appropriate <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system.
					Sometimes it's easier to copy and paste text into a new document.
					Make sure that only the correct people have access to the information.

			<p>You must use communications tools for business purposes in an

			<p>Be sensible when using communications tools for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> business purposes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Be extra careful with sensitive and personal information in tools.</li>
				<li>Try to avoid using the same tool for business and personal use - you can get confused who you're talking with.</li>
				<li>If the message you're about to send might cause problems, upset, offence, or embarrassment, it's not acceptable.</li>
				<li>Context is important - a message you might think is funny could be upsetting to someone else.</li>
				<li>If something goes wrong, report it.</li>

			<lq>You <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshallnot"/> install proctoring software onto <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment.</lq>
			<p>Some certification or examination organisations enable people to take assessments remotely. They do this by having 'supervision' software installed on the user's computer. This software is often referred to as 'proctoring software'. The tools make sure that the assessment is as fair as possible, by installing a variety of controls. For example, the software can take control of the camera and microphone of the device it is installed on.</p>
			<p>The problem is that the controls give the proctoring software extensive access to the computer. This means that the tools could inspect information or other applications on the computer. In effect, the proctoring software might have uncontrolled access to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information or materials on the computer. This is not acceptable.</p>
			<p>If you need to use proctoring software, your options are:
				<ul>
					<li>Install the proctoring software on a personal device.</li>
					<li>Contact the assessment organisation asking for alternative options.</li>

			<p>The official <xref href="https://www.nhs.uk/apps-library/nhs-covid-19/" format="html" scope="external">NHS Covid-19</xref> app was designed by the NHS.
			Both NCSC and Cabinet Office have been involved in the security of the system.
			The app provides contact tracing, local area alerts and venue check-in.
			It enables you to protect yourself and your loved ones.
			Installation is optional, but recommended.</p>
			<p>After installing the app, you'll receive an alert if you have been in close contact with other people who have tested positive for coronavirus.
			You can then take action to avoid passing the virus on, for example by self-isolating.</p>
			<p>From a security perspective,
				it is safe for you to use the app on your personal or <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> issued devices.
				There are no extra risks for colleagues with security clearance, such as SC and DV.</p>
			<p>If you wish to install the app, start at the <xref href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" format="html" scope="external">NHS site</xref>.
				<note>The NHS app may not work on some older <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> devices.
					Installation might not be possible, for example on MoJo smartphones.</note></p>
			<p>You might have both a personal and an <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> issued device.
				Think about which device makes most sense to use with the app.
				It's best to install on the device that you carry with you and use most of the time.
			You could install on all your devices if you prefer.</p>
			<p>To reduce the likelihood of false alerts on the app, turn off the app's Bluetooth mode.
				Do this when:
				<ul>
					<li>You are working in environments with protective Covid measures in-place,
						for example plexiglass separators.</li>
						<li>You need to leave your personal or work device in a locker, for example during a sports activity or to work in a secure <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> facility.</li>
