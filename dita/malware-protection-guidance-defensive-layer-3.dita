    <body>
      <p>This guide explains the types of controls that need to be implemented to form the third of three layers of defence. Layer 3 helps reduce the impact of malware infection in two ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>reducing the ability for malware to move across networks</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>ensuring that data is backed up</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This guide is a sub-page to the <xref href="malware-protection-guide-introduction.dita" format="dita" type="topic">Malware Protection Guide</xref>.</p>

        <p>This Malware Protection information is mainly intended for in-house <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects, and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge (EPICK) Team.</p>
        <p>Other <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> bodies, agencies, contractors, or IT suppliers and partners who in any way design, develop or supply services (including processing, transmitting and storing data) for, or on behalf of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>, will also find this information helpful.</p>

    <title>Defensive Layer 3: Resilience and Rapid Response</title>
    <body>
      <p>Even with the controls created by defensive layers 1 and 2, it is still possible that malware might reside and execute on the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> networks. The following controls can help to build resilience, ensure a rapid response to infection, and reduce the impact of a successful malware intrusion:</p>

    <title>Preventing and Detecting Lateral Movement</title>
    <body>
      <p>One of the most important ways of limiting the spread of malware on the network is to reduce lateral movement. This is where a malware problem 'jumps across' from system to system. The main ways to prevent lateral movement are covered in the tables below.</p>
