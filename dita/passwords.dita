			<p>You <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshallnot"/> share your password or account details with anyone, unless you have documented approval to share from your Line Manager or higher senior manager.</p>
			<p>If a system or another person provides you with a password, change it before doing any <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> work on that system.
				Examples of 'single-use' passwords include:
				<ul>
					<li>Your own account on a work-provided laptop.</li>
					<li>A shared account for accessing a data analytics service.</li>
					<li>All supplier or vendor supplied accounts.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>You <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> change a password whenever:
				<ul>
					<li>There has been a security incident involving your account or password. For example, someone guessed your password, or you used it on another account.</li>
					<li>There was a security incident with the service that you access using the password. For example, if someone broke into the system that provides the service you use.</li>
					<li>Your line manager or other authorised person tells you to do so.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>When required to change a password, you <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> do so as soon as possible.

			<title>App-based password protection for files</title>
			<body>
				<p>Some applications - including Microsoft Office tools such as Word, Excel, and Powerpoint - provide mechanisms for protecting files.
				A password controls whether someone can open,
				or edit, a file.</p>
				<p>While these app-based password protection mechanisms are better than
					nothing,
					there are three good reasons for avoiding them if possible.
				<ol>
					<li>You depend on the application to provide and maintain strong
						password protection.
						If the password implementation fails,
						or has a weakness,
						you might not know about it.
						This means that you might think your information is protected,
						when in fact it is at risk.</li>
					<li>It is tempting to use a standard password for protecting a file
					within the app,
					so that other people can share and work with the file.
					Changing the password becomes "inconvenient".
					The result is that many versions of the data file are all protected
					with the same password.
					Also,
					if anyone has ever been given the password to access the file,
					they will always be able to access the file.</li>
					<li>If you forget the app-based password,
					there might not be a recovery process available to you.</li>
				</ol></p>
				<p>For these reasons,
					<ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> advice is that you
					<ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshouldnot"/> use password tools
					within an app to protect data files that are processed by the app.
					For example,
					you <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshouldnot"/> use the password tools
					with Microsoft Word,
					Excel,
					or Powerpoint,
					to protect <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information within files.
					Instead,
					either:
					<ol>
						<li>Store the data files in a shared but secure area,
							such as the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>
							SharePoint storage facility.</li>
						<li>Use separate encryption tools to protect data files,
						separate from the app that works with the data files.</li>
					</ol></p>
					<p>Of these two options,
					storing data files in a shared but secure area is strongly preferred.
					The reason is that you can add,
					modify,
					or revoke access permissions to the storage area easily.</p>
				<p>If you have no choice,
				and have to use app-based password protection,
				ensure that the same password is not used indefinitely for a data file.
				You <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> use a different
				password for:
				<ul>
					<li>Each major version of a data file,
					for example version 2.x is different to version 3.x.</li>
					<li>Any data file where the password is more than three months old.</li>
				</ul></p>
				<note>This advice is a specific exception to the
					<xref href="#password-expiry" format="dita">general guidance</xref>,
				that you do not normally need to change passwords.</note>
			</body>
	</topic>
	<topic id="password-expiry">
		<title>Password expiry</title>
		<body>
			<p>You don't have to change a password because it is old. The reason is that time-expiry of passwords is an <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/your-password-expiry-policy-may-have-reached-its-expiry-date" scope="external" format="html">...outdated and ineffective practice</xref>.</p>
			<p>Some current or legacy systems don't allow passwords that follow <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> guidance. For example, some mobile devices, laptop hard drive encryption tools, or older computers might not be able to support a mix of character types. For such systems, choose passwords that are as close as possible to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> guidance.</p>

		<title>Password managers</title>
		<body>
			<p>Use a password manager to help you keep track of your passwords.</p>
			<p>These are tools that help you create, use, and manage your passwords. A useful overview is available <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/what-does-ncsc-think-password-managers" scope="external" format="html">here</xref>.</p>
			<p>As passwords become more complex, and you need to look after more of them, it becomes increasingly necessary to use a password manager.
				<ph audience="audience-basic audience-tech">For example, development teams in <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Digital &amp; Technology use <xref href="using-1password.dita" format="dita">1Password</xref>.</ph></p>
			<p>You still need to remember one password.
			This is the password that gets you into the manager application.
			Once you have access, the application works like a simple database, storing all the passwords associated with your various accounts and services.
			Some managers have extra features, such as password generators.
			Some managers can even automatically fill-in username and password fields for you when during log in.</p>
			<p>The password manager database is often stored in the cloud so that you can use it anywhere.
			The database is encrypted, so only you can open it.
			That's why your single password key is so important.
			Without it, you can never get access to the password database again.</p>
			<p>Using a password manager for your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> account and service details is recommended.</p>

			<p audience="audience-tech">When performing a privileged action,

			<p>When you need an authentication solution, try to use existing <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> services.
			Examples include Identity Provider (IdP) or Single Sign-On (SSO) services, such as Office 365 or Digital and Technology G-Suite.</p>
			<p>This helps reduce the need to design, create, deploy and manage yet another solution.</p>
			<p>SSO integration in existing IdP solutions improves the user experience. This is because you can authenticate to systems using existing <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> credentials.</p>

			<p>This guidance on passwords is separate from the guidance on account management.
			You should still follow the rules and processes for managing accounts.
			In particular, while you don't need to <xref href="#password-expiry" format="dita">change passwords after a period of time</xref>, you should still expire accounts promptly.
			Examples would be when accounts are no longer required, or have fallen out of use.</p>
