    <body>
      <p>A password manager stores sensitive information in an encrypted form. Password managers are sometimes called password vaults.</p>
      <p>In the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>, password managers are tools that you might use for your personal accounts.
      Password vaults are tools that a team of people might use to look after details for shared accounts.</p>
      <p>Password vaults usually have extra strong access controls, such as hardware tokens.</p>
      <p>Here, we use password manager and 'password vault interchangeably, except when stated otherwise.</p>

      <p>A password manager should never store passwords in an unencrypted form. This means that keeping a list of passwords in a simple text file using Notepad would be A Bad Thing.</p>
      <p>Good password managers encrypt the passwords in a file using strong encryption. It shouldn't matter where you store the encrypted file.
        Storing the list "in the cloud" lets your password manager access the data from any device. This is useful if you are logging in from a laptop, or a mobile device. Storing the passwords locally means the password manager works even when offline.</p>
      <p>A good password manager will have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Strong encryption for the list of passwords.</li>
        <li>Network access for encrypted lists stored in the cloud.</li>
        <li>A dedicated app but also a pure web browser method for working with your password list.</li>
        <li>A tool to generate passwords of varying complexity.</li>
        <li>The ability to fill in login pages.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/what-does-ncsc-think-password-managers" format="html" scope="external">NCSC article</xref>, they are very careful not to identify or recommend a password manager. This ... caution ... is the reason why we don't say much about password managers within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> guidance.</p>
      <p>There are several password managers used within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>. <xref href="https://keepass.info/" format="html" scope="external">KeePass</xref> and <xref href="https://1password.com/" format="html" scope="external">1Password</xref> are probably the most popular for personal or team passwords. To determine whether a particular password manager is suitable for work usage, check the <xref href="general-user-video-and-messaging-apps-guidance.dita#password-managers/password-managers" format="dita" platform="html">General app guidance</xref><xref href="general-user-video-and-messaging-apps-guidance.dita#password-managers" format="dita" platform="epub pdf">General app guidance</xref>.</p>
      <p>Example password vaults would be Hashicorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets or AWS Key Management.</p>
      <p>For individual use, have a look at 1Password. Try it out. When you decide on a password manager, request approval from your line manager to install and use it: "I'm planning to install and use XYZ to manage my passwords, is that OK?".</p>
