      <p>Password managers come in several forms, for example, including standalone applications and those integrated into browsers or operating system.</p>
      <p>The MoJ provides a built-in browser password manager for use on supported browsers. When logging into a website, the browser will prompt you to save your credentials securely.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there are a small number of specific MoJ teams that have access to the <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/equipment/equipment-management/user-access/passwords/" format="html" scope="internal">password manager 1Password for their work.</xref></p>

    <title>Primary Password</title>
    <body>
      <p>While a password manager stores many of your passwords, you still need to remember the primary password that grants access to the password manager application and allows you to view stored passwords. The primary password cannot be stored within the manager itself.</p>
      <p>Key advantages of using a password manager include:
      <ul>
        <li>ability to quickly log into your accounts</li>
        <li>only the primary password needs to be remembered, rather than multiple complex passwords</li>
        <li>all stored passwords are encrypted for secure access</li>
        <li>avoids the need to reset forgotten passwords</li>
      </ul></p>

      <p>The MoJ recommends the following good practices when using a password manager:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the built-in browser password manager to store passwords securely</li>
        <li>Set a strong primary password by creating a password that is least 14 characters long by combining memorable multiple words together. An example is CyberSecurityRules! or Green8Duckmoonburger</li>
        <li>Store strong and unique passwords that meet the MoJ’s <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/equipment/equipment-management/user-access/passwords/" format="html" scope="internal">password guidance</xref></li>
        <li>Avoid sharing your passwords with others</li>
        <li>Promptly install software updates to maintain security</li>
        <li>Avoid storing passwords in unsecure formats, such as Notepad or Word documents</li>
      </ul>
