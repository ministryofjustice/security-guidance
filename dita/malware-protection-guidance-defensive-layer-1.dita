    <title>Introduction</title>
    <body>
      <p>This guide explains the types of controls that need to be implemented to form the first of three layers of defence. Layer 1 reduces the likelihood that malicious content will reach the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> network through implementing the controls outlined in this guide. This guide is a sub-page to the <xref href="malware-protection-guide-introduction.dita" format="dita" type="topic">Malware Protection Guide</xref>.</p>
