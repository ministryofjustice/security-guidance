    <p>The current draft of a templated
      <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> data destruction letter,
      that may be issued by the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> to a
      supplier.
      The letter describes required actions and information,
      followed by a responsive declaration from the supplier.</p>

      <p><b>Background</b></p>
      <p>For legislative,
        regulative,
        privacy and security purposes,
        it must be possible for Suppliers to decommission and delete
        (irreversibly "erase" or "destroy") data and warrant the same.
        Similarly,
        any storage media holding such data must be securely and comprehensively
        erased before reuse or disposal (such as at end-of-life).</p>
      <p>An example of a data destruction obligation is where a Supplier
        (acting as a "Data Processor",
        as defined by Data Protection legislation) working on behalf of,
        or supplying services to,
        the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> (the "Data Controller",
        as also defined by Data Protection legislation).
        The Data Processor,
        including any sub-processor instructed or otherwise involved in Data
        Processing on the Data Processor's behalf,
        must comply with instructions from the Data Controller regarding data
        irrespective of any commercial contract or promise such as a Data Subject
        exercising the "right to be forgotten".</p>
      <p>This document provides an acceptable data destruction baseline from the
        <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>,
        and associated declaration.
        When followed completely,
        this baseline for data destruction is considered sufficient to comply
        with data decommissioning and disposable tasks (and corresponding
        supplier assurances) for material classified as <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official"/>
        under the <xref
        href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications"
        format="html" scope="external">UK HMG Government Security Classifications
        Policy</xref> (including sensitive personal data or sensitive commercial
        data within the same).</p>
      <p><b>Data Lifecycle</b></p>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> informally acknowledge that
      automated systems involved in data management and associated lifecycles
      may not be capable of immediate decommissioning data on demand.
      Examples of such systems are data backup and disaster recovery solutions
      that have a defined and automated data cycle and retention system.</p>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> require positive
      confirmation of the final date by which these systems will have completed
      their data lifecycle tasks and data destruction will have been completed by.</p>
      <p>Where data cannot be erased immediately,
        there must be methods in place to limit and constrain access to the data
        until the data lifecycle is complete or manual intervention can be made
        and subsequent data destruction assured.</p>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> reserves all rights
      regarding instructions relating to data.
      This includes any need for immediate data destruction.</p>
      <p><b>Standards</b></p>
      <p>The following standards and guidelines are the <i>minimum</i> basis for
      data decommissioning or destruction.
      Follow and apply them as appropriate.
      There might also be extra steps specific to a data set or system.</p>
