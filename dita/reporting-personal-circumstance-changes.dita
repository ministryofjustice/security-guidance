    <p><b>Reporting changes in personal circumstances for staff with National Security Vetting.</b></p>
    <p>National Security Vetting decisions are made based on information available at the point of clearance.
      However,
      people's lives change over the course of a clearance.
      It is important that relevant changes are reported so that any risks can be assessed and managed.</p>
    <p>To maintain your security clearance,
      it is your responsibility to declare relevant changes in your personal circumstances to
      <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/vettingaftercareemailtext"/>.
      Failure to report relevant changes could result in withdrawal of clearance.</p>
    <p>You <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> contact
      <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/vettingaftercareemailtext"/> if there is any significant change
      in your personal circumstances
      and <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> alert your line manager or contact the
      <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/vettingaftercareemailtext"/> directly if you become aware
      of any other issue which might increase your security vulnerability.</p>
    <p>Please contact <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/vettingaftercareemailtext"/>
      if you have any of the following changes to your personal circumstances.</p>

        <p>In some cases where further checks need to be conducted,
          you are asked to complete a Change of Personal Circumstance questionnaire.
          You are asked to complete this form if you hold a security clearance
          (Developed Vetting (DV),
          Security Check (SC),
          or Counter-Terrorist Check (CTC)),
          under the following circumstances:
          <ul>
            <li>When you get married,
              enter a civil partnership,
              or start living with a partner as a couple.</li>
            <li>If you hold a DV clearance,
              when a new co-resident (anyone aged 18 or over for example lodgers,
              flat-mates,
              etc.) begins living with you in shared accommodation.</li>

    <topic id="changes-in-circumstances-for-another-member-of-sc-cleared-staff">
      <title>Changes in circumstances for another member of SC cleared staff</title>
      <body>
        <p>If you become aware of a change in circumstance for another member of security cleared staff,
          you <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> remind them of their responsibility
          to report this to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/vettingaftercareemailtext"/>.</p>
        <p>You must alert your line manager or <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/vettingaftercareemailtext"/>
          if you become aware of any other issues which might increase your security vulnerability,
          or the security vulnerability of a security cleared colleague.
          All staff <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> be mindful of circumstances and behaviours
          that might render staff susceptible to pressure,
          or improper influence,
          or could otherwise indicate unreliability.</p>
        <p>Other obvious changes in circumstances,
          aside from those already listed previously, are:
          <ul>
            <li>Serious financial problems.</li>
            <li>Substance and drug abuse.</li>
            <li>Alcohol abuse.</li>
            <li>Illegal or injudicious behaviour,
              including when living or travelling overseas.</li>
            <li>Compulsive gambling.</li>
            <li>Involvement with extreme political groups or inappropriate associations.</li>
            <li>Sexual behaviour is a security concern if it involves a criminal activity,
              indicates a personality or emotional disorder,
              subjects the individual to coercion,
              exploitation,
              or duress,
              or reflects lack of judgement or discretion.
              Sexual orientation or preference are not in themselves disqualifying factors,
              and are not used as a basis for clearance decisions.</li>
          </ul></p>
        <p>All reports are treated in strict confidence.
          It is always better to alert a line manager or contact
          <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/vettingaftercareemailtext"/> directly,
          rather than to ignore an issue or take no action.</p>
