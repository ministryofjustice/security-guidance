        <p>A Code of Connection (CoCo) is designed to provide a mechanism to record a formal agreement between a 3rd party organisation and the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> on the security measures to be applied by that 3rd party prior to and during any electronic connection with a <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT system, for example, to facilitate the exchange of data between two case management systems.</p>

        <p>In order to meet these requirements, the SPF stipulates that IT systems must:</p>

      <title>Context</title>
      <body>
        <p>A Code of Connection (CoCo) is designed to provide evidence to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> that a connecting 3rd party understands the security controls and procedures required to connect to a <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT system and that those controls and procedures have been implemented. The aim here is to ensure that the risks associated with connecting IT systems together are sufficiently mitigated in the technical solution and managed on an ongoing basis during live operation.</p>
        <note> This standard is based on connecting a RESTRICTED-IL3 <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT system with an Accredited 3rd party RESTRICTED-IL3 IT system where all electronic communication is over an Accredited RESTRICTED-IL3 network/s and/or RESTRICTED-IL3 communications channel. Where this is not the case, advice must be sort from the IT Security Officer (ITSO) and system Accreditor.</note>
        <p>A generic CoCo (based on the previous note) is provided in Appendix A; it is split into two sections:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>basic requirement (refer to section A.1) – The section outlines the base set of CoCo requirement which need to be met by the connecting 3rd party</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>supporting compliance statement (refer to section A.2) – This section contains a series of compliance statements based on ISO 27001 and the <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/information-risk-management-hmg-ia-standard-numbers-1-2" format="html" scope="external">IAS 1&amp;2 Baseline Controls Set (BCS)</xref>. It is designed to provide a mechanism for a connecting 3rd party to supply compliance evidence to the system Accreditor.  Section 3.2 provides details on how this compliance statement should be applied.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note:</b> A signed CoCo between the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> and the connecting 3rd party is required before the connection can go into live operation.</p>

      <title>Managing the risk of connectivity</title>
      <body>
        <p>In order to ensure that the connectivity and sharing of electronic data between a <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT system and a 3rd party IT system does not cause undue risk from one participating organisation to another, each organisation must reasonably comply with the code of connection to ensure any risks are managed effectively.</p>
        <p>The need for a CoCo and its application will be determined by the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system Accreditor who will consider the risks involved, this may require the production of a technical risk assessment and/or RMADS for the connection (further details on RMADS can be found in the <xref href="infrastructure-system-accreditation.dita" format="dita">Accreditation Framework</xref> ).</p>
        <p>The CoCo condition and compliance statement contained within the generic CoCo document (refer to A.1.3) provide a good platform to judge whether the assurance level of the connecting 3rd party IT system is sufficient rather than just relying on its accreditation status. A risk based approach must be taken to the application of security controls associated with the connection. The generic CoCo (refer to Appendix A) provides a baseline by which a 3rd party IT system's connection to a <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT system will be assessed. The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system Accreditor will provide a steer as to how this should be applied, where the default steer is that the guidance provided in <xref href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/information-risk-management-hmg-ia-standard-numbers-1-2" format="html" scope="external">IAS 1&amp;2 Baseline Controls Set (BCS)</xref> at the DETER level should be applied.</p>
        <p>It is highly likely that the connection between the two systems will be over the GSi.  If so, the 3rd party organisation is likely to have completed the GSi Code of Connection for that system connection. The information requested in the generic CoCo is similar to that required for the GSi CoCo and as such should be readily available.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Depending on the protocols being used, the GSi authority may need to be contacted.</p>

      <title>Completing a Code of Connection</title>
      <body>
        <p>The IT System Manager and/or ITSO for the connecting 3rd party organisation must review CoCo and submit the supporting compliance statement to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system Accreditor along with any supporting documentation.</p>
        <p>In completing the CoCo statement, the connecting 3rd party organisation confirms that they have implemented all the controls required, it should be noted that the adoption of these controls will not totally mitigate all the risks involved whether to the 3rd party's own IT system or to the connecting <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT system.</p>
        <p>Where the connecting 3rd party IT system does not comply with the controls outlined in the CoCo, the IT System Manager and/or ITSO must provide supporting comments including a high-level plan that outlines the expected timeline to meet them.</p>
        <p>An approval from the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> system Accreditor is required prior to the connection going into live operation.</p>
