    <title>The base principle</title>
    <body>
      <p>All systems <b>must</b> be protected against commodity malware threats through, but not limited to, known malware through signature-based checks.</p>
      <p>Any issues found must be proportionally considered for remediation (in general, this is file deletion or escalation for review after quarantine) prior to releasing any files or data for consumption.</p>

    <title>Ransomware</title>
    <body>
      <p>Some malware encrypt or obfuscate data and attempt to extort payment from the victim(s) in order for the decryption to take place. Such malware typically attempts to influence any file available, including remote storage.</p>
      <p>Techniques must be in place to isolate and ensure backup regimes are adequately defended against ransomware to avoid backup files being modified by such malware.</p>

    <title>Network propagation</title>
    <body>
      <p>Some malware propagate by scanning the visibile networking space for other hosts to turn into victims. Network-level segregation and defences must be in place to limit lateral infection movement.</p>
