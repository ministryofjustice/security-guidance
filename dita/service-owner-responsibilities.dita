        <body>
            <p>This document sets out the security responsibilities you have as the person ultimately responsible for a bespoke technology or digital service ("the technology owner") in the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/>.</p>
            <p>The list of items below can look intimidating at first glance. However, depending on the nature of your service or technology, some of these items might be quite small.</p>
            <p>Every <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Service <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> have an identified person responsible for performing each of the activities listed below.</p>
            <p>One person <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymay"/> be responsible for multiple items, provided they have the appropriate skills and training to perform each duty satisfactorily. The Product or Service Owner is responsible for ensuring these activities are allocated and carried out.</p>
            <p>Whilst these activities might be performed by a supplier or sub-contractor as part of delivering the service, as Product or Service Owner you remain responsible for ensuring that contract(s) require your supplier(s) to perform these activities in accordance with <xref href="cyber-and-technical-security-guidance.dita" format="dita"><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Security Policies</xref>.</p>
            <p>The activities do not necessarily need to be performed within your team – for example, you might 'outsource' them to another area such as the Justice Digital Security Operations Centre. You remain responsible for ensuring there is a clear understanding of who is doing what in these relationships.</p>

                <p>Supporting and educating users on how they access and use your service securely. This is context-dependent and might be as simple as ensuring that in-built user guidance helps explain security concepts in your service. For complicated end-user services, this might require eLearning or other targeted training. If you provide a platform, this might involve specific guidance for other services built on it, to explain their security responsibilities.</p>
