    <p>This guide is designed to help protect <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/>
    information held on <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems,

        <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/gov007"/> identifies mandatory
        requirements about the value and classification of information assets.
          To comply with these requirements,
          the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> needs to ensure that:
        <lq>Where information is shared for business purposes,
          departments and agencies <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/>
          ensure the receiving party understands
          the obligations and protects the assets appropriately.</lq>
        and
        <lq>All staff handling sensitive government assets are briefed about how
          legislation (particularly regarding Freedom of Information and Data
          Protection) specifically relates to their role,
          including the potential disciplinary or criminal penalties that may
          result from failure to comply with security policies.
          Appropriate management structures
          <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> be in place to ensure
          the proper handling,
          control and (if appropriate) managed disclosure of sensitive
          assets.</lq></p>
        <p>The policy on data handling and information sharing is covered in the
          <xref href="information-classification-and-handling-policy.dita"
            format="dita" audience="audience-suppliers audience-tech">Information
            Classification and Handling Policy</xref><ph
            audience="audience-basic">Information Classification and Handling
            Policy</ph>,
            whilst this document sets out the
            <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> guidance sharing information
            within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> and externally
            with other Government departments and 3rd parties.</p>
        <note>Other guidance might refer to information classified as being
          <codeph>IL3 REST*</codeph>.
        This is an older classification standard.
        In general,
        <codeph>IL3 REST*</codeph> is approximately equivalent to
        <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official"/>
        with the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/sensitive"/> handling caveat,
        often written as<ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official-sensitive"/>.
        While this approximate alignment might be helpful,
        you should always review classification where older terms are used,
        to ensure that the correct current classification is used.</note>

            <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> preference for

              <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official-sensitive"/>,
              a base level of assurance is provided.
              However, consideration will need to be given to the following
              factors to ascertain if any additional security controls are
              required:
            <ul>
              <li>The amount of data being transferred.</li>

          <p>"Data at rest" is a term used to refer to all data in computer
          storage.
            This excludes data that is traversing a network,
            or temporarily residing in computer memory to be read or updated.
            The protection of data at rest is achieved by encrypting the hard
            disk.
            <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>-issued laptops use an approved
            whole disk encryption product.

          <body>
            <p>Where there is a business requirement to do so,
              sensitive information may be shared with a 3rd party using a
              commercial grade encryption product such as SecureZip.
              Further information on the use of SecureZip can be found in
              <xref href="#using-securezip" format="dita">Using SecureZIP</xref>.</p>
            <note>File encryption does not protect the name of the file.
              This could reveal clues as to the nature and importance of the
              encrypted data.
              Encrypted files should be given innocuous names for transmission.
              If the data is contained in numerous small files,
              these should be collected together into a single archive
              ("zip") file.
              This archive should then be encrypted.
              Each file or archive should be sent separately,
              rather than attaching multiple encrypted files to a single email.</note>

    <body>
      <p>The Data Movement Form (DMF) is available <xref href="file:///./gs/data-movement-form.docx"
        format="docx" scope="external" platform="html">here</xref><xref href="https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/gs/data-movement-form.docx"
          format="docx" platform="epub pdf" scope="external">here</xref>.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the DMF is to ensure that the movement of information
        assets is secure,
        and in compliance with the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/gov007"/>.</p>
      <p>Failure to fulfil or comply with the controls and measures identified
        within the DMF will lead to unnecessary risk or exposure for the
        <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>,
        or the relevant Information Asset Owner (IAO),
        or the Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO).</p>
      <p>A DMF <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> be completed,
        and approval received from the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/securityemailtext"/>,
        for the following scenarios:
        <ul>
          <li>Data is being moved or shared by using a physical storage device to
            transfer the information.
          An example is where you use a "memory stick",
          a USB drive,
          a storage array,
          or some other removable media.
        The DMF in this scenario focuses on the data being moved or shared.</li>
          <li>Data is being moved or shared by electronic (network) communication,
            where the movement is from an <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>
            IT system to an external party.
          An example is using secure file transfer or approved email to transfer
        the information.
      The DMF in this scenario focuses on the data being moved or shared.</li>
          <li>An asset (a "data bearing asset") is being moved to,
          or transported by,
          an external party.
          This might be as a result of an office move,
          or because the asset is being decommissioned.
            The asset might contain or process <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>
            information.
            Examples of data bearing assets include laptops,
            servers,
            multi-functional devices,
            and any other data bearing peripherals.
          The DMF in this scenario focuses on the asset being moved or
          transported,
          rather than the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information
          that the asset might contain or process.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>A DMF <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/>
        be submitted to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/securityemailtext"/>
        for information purposes,
        in the following scenarios:
          <ul>
            <li>Data is being moved or shared by electronic (network) communication,
              where the movement is entirely within or between
              <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems.</li>
            <li>Data is being moved in full compliance with the already-approved
              service design and operation specification and procedures.</li>
                  <li>An asset (a "data bearing asset") is being moved
                  but remains within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>
                  or its supplier-provided and
                  <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>-approved facilities at
                  all times.</li>
          </ul>
        <note>In the informational scenarios,
        a DMF is only expected the first time a data movement or sharing takes
        place.
        Subsequent,
        repeat instances of the movement or sharing,
        do not require a re-submission of the DMF.
        For example,
        when setting up a backup process as part of an approved service design,
        a DMF is created and submitted to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/securityemailtext"/>
        for information purposes,
        but does not need to be re-created or re-submitted for each backup occurrence.
        If the implementation or process for the data movement or sharing changes,
        for example a new new backup technology or process is deployed,
        then a fresh informational DMF is required.</note>
      </p>
      <p>In any case of doubt,
        it is always advisable to complete a DMF
        and await approval or other feedback from the
        <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/securityemailtext"/>.</p>

    <title>Using SecureZIP</title>
    <body>
      <p>SecureZip is a compression and encryption product which can be used to
        encrypt sensitive data for use in removable media and email based
        information transfers.</p>
      <note>SecureZip can produce "self-extracting" encrypted files that are
      executable programs which are likely to be blocked by network firewalls or
      email content checkers.</note>
      <p>The general rules for transmitting a password to a recipient are:
      <ul>
        <li>Never transfer the password with the encrypted file, or even over the
          same communication channel.
        Use an alternative method, for example if an encrypted file is sent by
        email, communicate the password or key via SMS text message, letter, fax
        or phone call.</li>
        <li>Transfer the encrypted data file first.
        Only send the password or key after the recipient has confirmed receipt
        of the file.</li>
        <li>Avoid detailing the purpose of a password when it is sent.</li>
        <li>Avoid re-using passwords and demonstrate good security discipline to
          3rd parties by creating a completely new password or phrase for each
          transmission.</li>
      </ul></p>
