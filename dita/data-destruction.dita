  <title>Data Destruction</title>
  <body>
    <p>'Data destruction' is the process of erasing or otherwise destroying data stored on virtual/electronic or physical mediums such as, but not limited to, printed copies, tapes and hard disks in order to completely render data irretrievable and inaccessible and otherwise void.</p>

    <title>The base principle</title>
    <body>
      <p>For legislative, regulative, privacy and security purposes, it <b>must</b> be possible to decommission and delete (irreversibly 'erase' or 'destroy') data and confirm to a degree of relative confidence it has been completed.</p>
      <p>Data should be erased from all related systems, such as disaster recovery, backup and archival, subject to reasonable data lifecycle caveats.</p>

    <body>
      <p>The following standards and guidelines are the <i>minimum</i> basis for data decommissioning or destruction. Follow and apply them as appropriate. There might also be extra steps specific to a data set or system.</p>

    <title>Data lifecycle caveats</title>
    <body>
      <p>Automated systems involved in data management and associated lifecycles may not be capable of immediate destroying data on demand.</p>
      <p>Examples of such systems are data backup and disaster recovery solutions that have a defined and automated data cycle and retention system.</p>
      <p>There is generally no need to attempt to manually delete such data prior to the automated retention lapse as long as it is ensured that if the data is restored prior to data destruction it is not processed.</p>
      <p>It is important that the final expected data where all data lifecycles will have completed to be readily identifiable with high confidence.</p>
