            <note>This guidance applies also to the contents of personal information systems, such as notebooks.</note></p>

        <p>All <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information is valuable. There is a requirement to protect everything that relates to the department's business, including information provided by others.
            <note>The protection requirement applies to all information, not just information that is covered by the Data Protection Act or classified under the <xref href="government-classification-scheme.dita" format="dita" audience="audience-basic audience-suppliers audience-tech">government-wide security classification system</xref><ph audience="audience-gs">government-wide security classification system</ph>.</note></p>
        <p>There are different rules for managing and protecting various kinds of paper-based information. You <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> know how to:

            <body>
                <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> uses the government-wide <xref href="government-classification-scheme.dita" format="dita" audience="audience-basic audience-suppliers audience-tech">security classification system</xref><ph audience="audience-gs">security classification system</ph> to indicate the level of security that the various types of information require. The different classifications are based upon the harm that would be caused if controls were breached.</p>
                <p><b>POL.PPR.002</b>: Within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official"/> classification, material does not normally need to have the classification written on it. However, particularly sensitive information <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> be marked with the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official-sensitive"/> handling caveat if it requires more robust access and handling controls to prevent more damaging consequences from disclosure.</p>
                <p><b>POL.PPR.003</b>: Information handled in the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> might not always have a visible classification marking. If any file contains material with a marking, then the cover of the file <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> be marked with the highest level of any of the contents.</p>
                <p>To identify the right security level for information, think about:
                <ul>
                    <li><p>How sensitive that information is.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Whether it contains personal data that could be used to identify individuals.</p></li>
                    <li><p>What the consequences might be if the information was compromised or misused.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Whether the information is likely to be under threat from anyone with a high intercept capability. If so, the information might require marking at a higher classification than <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official"/>. <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/higherclassification"/></p></li>
                </ul></p>

            <title>Handling paper-based information in the office</title>
            <body>
                <p>Think carefully before leaving papers unattended on desks, in the same way that you would avoid leaving your own personal correspondence – or even a purse or wallet – in plain view.</p>
                <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> has a <xref href="clear-screen-and-desk.dita" format="dita" audience="audience-basic audience-suppliers audience-tech">clear desk policy</xref><ph audience="audience-gs">clear desk policy</ph> that is intended to ensure information is seen only by people who 'need to know' it.</p>
                <p>This means:
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Not leaving documents or files on a desk when not being used.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Locking documents or files in a secure cabinet when you leave the office.</p></li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>Failure to follow this policy could expose files and papers to the risk of being seen during the working day by other staff, or visitors to the office and, out of hours, by guards and cleaners. Even apparently non-sensitive information should be looked after. Putting papers away also protects them from damage from fire, smoke, or water.</p>
                <p>There are different controls regarding how the various levels of classified information are secured. Refer to the <xref href="information-classification-handling-and-security-guide.dita" format="dita" audience="audience-basic audience-suppliers audience-tech">Information classification, handling and security guide</xref><ph audience="audience-gs">Information classification, handling and security guide</ph> for more information.</p>

            <body>
                <p>Occasionally, you might need to take <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information outside <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> premises. Examples might be when you are working from home, or moving between <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> buildings. At such times, it is likely that you'll be carrying valuable information within documents, paper files and personal notebooks.</p>
                <p><b>POL.PPR.007</b>: Always check first whether it is really necessary to take documents out of the office. If it is essential to do so, you <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> get permission from your line management, especially if the information includes:
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Personal information, including anything that relates to an identifiable individual or individuals, such as <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> staff, stakeholders, partners, or customers.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Material marked <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official-sensitive"/>.</p></li>
                </ul></p>
                <p><b>POL.PPR.008</b>: You <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> get permission from a head of division, or from a member of the Senior Civil Service (SCS) if the information is marked at a level higher than <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official-sensitive"/>. Removal or relocation of information marked at a level higher than <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official-sensitive"/> <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> be noted and recorded on a register, and a record kept of when the material is logged back in.</p>
                <p><b>POL.PPR.009</b>: If you are carrying papers out of the office, you <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> protect them against accidental loss such as an accident or distraction, causing you to drop or misplace them.</p>
                <p><b>POL.PPR.010</b>: Ideally, carry papers in an unmarked case. For papers marked <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official-sensitive"/> or higher, or when using public transport, you <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> use a lockable case.</p>
                <p><b>POL.PPR.011</b>: For short journeys, such as on foot, and where you are not stopping or using public transport, it is acceptable to carry <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/official"/> papers in a plain envelope, marked only with your name and office address.</p>
                <p><b>POL.PPR.012</b>: If carrying papers to a meeting at a different location, you <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshallnot"/> allow sensitive details to be visible. The reason is that they could be photographed by a journalist.</p>
                <p><b>POL.PPR.012.001</b>: Papers <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> be stapled together or otherwise secured in a package. This is to limit dispersal if the carrying case or envelope becomes damaged or opened.</p>
                <p><b>POL.PPR.013</b>: Cases or envelopes <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> have the minimum details necessary on the outside to assure safe return of the item, if lost, without having to be opened to reveal the contents.</p>
                <p><b>POL.PPR.014</b>: Documents <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymustnot"/> be left unattended in public places or in an unattended car. Care <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> be taken if you are reading protectively marked information in public places where you might be overlooked, such as a train, or where it might be difficult to retrieve a document if you lost hold of it, for example if you dropped it, or it was blown away.</p>
                <p>If you are taking papers home, ensure that they are not readily accessible to other members of your household. Take precautions to minimise their loss. If the papers would normally be locked away in the office, try to do the same at home.</p>
