    <p>This document is the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> Acceptable Use Policy. It provides the core set of security principles and expectations on the acceptable use of <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems.</p>

      <p><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems and services are first and foremost provided to support the delivery of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>'s business services.
      To achieve this, most <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> users are provided with an appropriate general purpose computer environment, and access to services and communication tools such as email and the Internet.</p>
      <p>This policy outlines the acceptable use of <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems and services, and the expectations that the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> has on its staff when accessing or using those systems or services.</p>

        <li>For <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> employees, disciplinary proceedings up to and including dismissal.</li>
        <li>For others with access to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems and services, including specifically contractors and agency staff, termination of contract.</li>
      </ul></p>

    <title>Protection of assets</title>
    <body>
      <p>It is paramount that all Users protect the confidentiality of information held on, processed, and transmitted by <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems. All Users have a role in protecting the information assets which are under their control, or that they have access to.</p>
      <p><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems have been designed to protect the confidentiality of the data held on them. However, maintaining this requires the application of, and adherence to, a clear set of operating procedures by all Users.
        These are collectively known as Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs).</p>
      <p>It is important that all Users of an IT system, including support and system administrative Users, are familiar with these SyOPs, and are provided with the appropriate training.</p>
      <p><b>POL.ITAUP.003</b>: All IT systems <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> have, and maintain, a set of Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs). For systems undergoing an assurance process, these SyOPs <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> be included as part of the assurance.</p>
      <p><b>POL.ITAUP.004</b>: All Users of an IT system, including support and system administrative staff, <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> read the applicable SyOPs, and <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> acknowledge that they have both read and understood the SyOPs before being granted access. A record <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> be kept of a User being granted access, and made available for review during assurance, or upon authorised request.</p>
      <p><b>POL.ITAUP.005</b>: All Users <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> be made aware that non-conformance to the system SyOPs constitutes a breach of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> <xref href="it-security-policy-overview.dita" format="dita">IT Security Policy</xref>, and <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymight"/> result in disciplinary action.</p>
      <p><b>POL.ITAUP.006</b>: Any change to an IT system's SyOPs <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> be approved through an assured change control process, before the change is made.</p>
      <p><b>POL.ITAUP.007</b>: Any request to perform an action on an IT system which contravenes its SyOPs <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> be approved by the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/securityemailtext"/> before the action is taken.</p>
      <p>For most Users, access to <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems and information held on them is through a desktop device, a laptop, or a mobile or remote device. These devices have the capacity to store large amounts of potentially sensitive information assets. It is important that Users follow Information Management processes and handling guidelines to ensure information is stored and accessed appropriately. Further information on information handling is provided in the <xref href="information-classification-and-handling-policy.dita" format="dita">Information Classification and Handling Policy</xref>.</p>

      <body>
        <p>The policy refers to a key set of general SyOPs, as follows:
        <ul>
          <!-- FIXME -->

        </ul></p>
        <p>To minimise the number of SyOPs in circulation and standardise procedures, the SyOPs listed previously act as the primary set, which individual IT systems are expected to conform to, in terms of their own SyOPs. Any deviations or additions are dependent upon approval through the assurance process.</p>
        <p><b>POL.ITAUP.008</b>: All IT systems <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymust"/> have documented SyOPs which comply with the general SyOPs <xref href="#general-security-operating-procedures-syops" format="dita">listed in this policy</xref>.

        <note>An IT system <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymay"/> make use of, in their entirety, one or more of the SyOPs listed in this policy if the procedures of that IT system do not deviate from those described in the general SyOPs.</note>

      <p>Due to the risks associated with electronic communications such as email and the Internet, the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> controls and monitors usage of <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> systems in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
      <p>IT systems are designed to protect the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> from Internet-borne attacks, to reduce the risk of <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information being leaked or compromised, and to support the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> in providing a safe working environment.

      <p>Also, the use of any high bandwidth services, such as video streaming websites, <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymight"/> create network capacity issues, causing poor performance affecting important <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> services.

      <p><b>POL.ITAUP.029</b>: The default position is that <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> personal data <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshallnot"/> be transferred to or through, or stored, in the US or elsewhere outside the UK, EEA, or an ADC, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p>
      <p>This position also applies where a supplier uses cloud storage facilities in the UK, EEA, or an ADC, but their employees outside the UK, EEA, or the ADC are able to view the information for activities such as maintenance or trouble-shooting. The effect of this access is equivalent to the personal data being held outside the UK, EEA, or an ADC.</p>
      <p>The reason for this position is that even with additional contractual clauses, the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> cannot ensure protection of its personal data stored outside the UK, EEA, or an ADC, due to some government surveillance laws.</p>
      <p><b>POL.ITAUP.030</b>: A supplier based in the UK, EEA, or an ADC, and which stores client data in the UK, EEA, or an ADC, <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshould"/> be considered first and preferred where possible.</p>
      <p><b>POL.ITAUP.031</b>: If an alternative supplier cannot be sourced, then a Standard Contractual Clause (SCC) and a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> be completed.</p>
      <p>These documents are reviewed by the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/privacyemailtext"/>, after which the transfer <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policymight"/> be approved. A template for these documents can be requested from <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/privacyemail"/></p>
      <p><b>POL.ITAUP.032</b>: If the outcome of the assessment does not support the transfer and storage of information outside the UK, EEA, or an ADC, the Information Security and Risk (ISR) Board <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> review the case, and if appropriate, accept the risks in order for the supplier to be used.</p>
      <p><b>POL.ITAUP.033</b>: This acceptable use policy for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> personal data <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> apply to:
      <ul>
        <li>An existing supplier changing the location of its servers, storage, or services outside the UK, EEA, or an ADC.</li>
