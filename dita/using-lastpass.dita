    <title>What is LastPass?</title>
    <body>
      <p>LastPass is an online password management tool that we make available to you to help you create, store and share passwords. Using it means you no longer need to remember dozens of passwords, just a single primary password. It keeps all your website logins protected, helps with creating new 'strong' passwords and password sharing when required.</p>
      <p>LastPass is available as a browser extension for popular browsers and as well as a full software suite (for use outside of browsers) for Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS.</p>
      <p>LastPass will securely save your credentials in your own LastPass 'Vault' and then offer to autofill those credentials the next time you need them.</p>
      <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> has the Enterprise tier of LastPass.</p>

        <p>At the moment, rollout is limited to technical service or operations teams that have a need for shared passwords.</p>

      <title>What it can be used for</title>
      <body>
        <p>LastPass can be used for sharing passwords within a team, when individual named accounts cannot be created in the service. A good example is running a shared Twitter account.</p>
        <note>If you have a business need for a shared Twitter account, consider using a more enterprise-orientated tool for social media posting, such as <xref href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/" format="html" scope="external">TweetDeck</xref> or <xref href="https://www.hootsuite.com/" format="html" scope="external">Hootsuite</xref>. You need <xref href="general-user-video-and-messaging-apps-guidance.dita" format="dita">formal approval</xref> to use tools like these.</note>

          <p>You <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshouldnot"/> use your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> LastPass account to store personal non-work information as it is a work account belonging to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.

          <p><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> LastPass administrators cannot routinely access the contents of LastPass Vaults but can reset accounts to gain access if there is a good reason to do so.</p>

          <p>You need to create a primary password - this is the only password you'll need to remember.</p>
          <p>It must be at least 12 characters long (the longer the better).</p>
          <p>You can choose to make it pronounceable and memorable (passphrase) such as <codeph>CyberSecurityRules!</codeph> or <codeph>Sup3rD00p3rc0Mp3X!</codeph>, as long as you're comfortable remembering it and won't need to write it down.</p>
