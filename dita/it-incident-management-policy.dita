  <title>IT Incident Management Policy</title>
  <body>
    <p>Incident management is the ability to react to security incidents in a controlled, pre-planned manner. Preparation and planning are key factors to successful information security management and all <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> systems rely on Incident Management Plans for safe and secure operations.</p>
    <p>The aim of this policy is to ensure best practice is followed by all IT systems when dealing with security incidents, in particular, those pertaining to data loss, in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
    <p>
      <b>POL.IMP.001:</b>
    </p>
    <p>Each <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Business Group <b>must have</b> an IT Security Incident Management Plan which aligns to this policy. This plan must be common to all IT systems within a particular business group.</p>
    <p>A template plan and guidance on the construction of an IT Security Incident Management Plan is provided in <xref href="incident-management-plan-and-process-guide.dita" format="dita">IT Security â€“ Incident Management Plan and Process guide</xref>.</p>

    <title>Incident Management Process</title>
    <body>
      <p>An incident management process is a prepared course of actions that will be instigated upon the detection or report of a security incident. Incident management requires a variety of decisions to be made, drawing on the experience of a number of roles, depending on the nature of the incident.</p>

      <title>Definition of an Incident</title>
      <body>
        <p>For the purposes of this policy, an incident is defined as any event or action which results in an actual and/or potential compromise of a <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT asset or <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Information Asset (including personal data).</p>
        <p>Such events will result in the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>, individuals or IT systems and/or the information held on them being exposed, or potentially exposed, to illegitimate access. As a result, incidents have the potential to compromise <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> business delivery, the Data Protection Act, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of IT systems and the information held on them. This may, in turn cause harm, distress or other damage to individuals or organisations, and result in operational disruption or reputation damage to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>.</p>

      <body>
        <p>Security Incidents may come to light from a variety of sources, including through protective monitoring solutions, reports filled by <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> staff or breaches of the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT Security Policy detected by an IT system.</p>

        <p>This section of the policy is concerned with taking those security events and ensuring that if an event relates to an actual IT Security incident, this incident is appropriately recorded.</p>

          <b>POL.IMP.002:</b>
        </p>

      <body>
        <p>Security incidents are categorised in order to assess their impact and required level of escalation. This is to ensure that the appropriate resources can be allocated and incident resolution is conducted in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>The three categories are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>

          <p>Low impact incidents would typically be minor internal infractions, such as, a low level breach in IT Security, or, a minor loss of an IT service (e.g. due to a short loss of power).</p>
          <p>A low impact personal data incident would typically include an incident where no actually data had been lost but a weakness in an IT system which may have led to a potential loss is discovered where a relatively small amount of remedial action is required to address the vulnerability.</p>

        <p>A generic escalation path is provided <xref href="#it-security-incident-escalation-path" format="dita">here</xref>.
