  <body>
    <p>This document is the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/> guidance covering
      disposal of physical and on-premise media and data. 
      It is intended to ensure that the confidentiality and integrity
      of <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> data
      is maintained when physical hardware is decommissioned.</p>

    <p>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> and its Executive Agencies
      and Arms Length Bodies use a wide variety of equipment,
      including photocopiers and printers,
      data centre hard and tape drives,
      desktop computers,
      laptops,
      USB memory sticks,
      and generic mobile devices.
      Some equipment might be the responsibility of a supplier
      to decommission and dispose of it safely and securely.
      Check asset tags or similar identifiers to determine and
      validate responsibility.</p>
    <p>However,
      other devices across the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> estate
      might have been procured and managed locally.
      They <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> be disposed of securely,
      to prevent <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> information
      from being <q>leaked</q>.</p>

      <title>Determining data deletion and destruction methods</title>
      <body>
    <p>To determine the data disposal and the media's destruction method,
      based on the type of equipment and its security classification,
      use the following table.</p>
      <p>The table contains two columns,
        called <q>Data deletion method</q> and <q>Destruction method</q>,
        which are defined as:
        <dl>
          <dlentry>
            <dt>Data deletion method</dt>
            <dd>Covers assets if they remain within the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>,
              and have not reached end of life.
              For example,
              the device can be re-used or reallocated to a different user,
              or repurposed for a different function.</dd>
          </dlentry>
          <dlentry>
            <dt>Destruction method</dt>
            <dd>Covers assets that have reached end of life,
              and need to be physically destroyed onsite or offsite.</dd>
          </dlentry>
        </dl></p>
        <note>If the data is encrypted,
          then only the key needs to be deleted or erased,
          and the table does not need to be followed.</note>
        <p>If the table does not cover your exact requirement,

    <note>A lower level degauss is a process using specialised equipment to erase data totally,
      by eliminating the unwanted magnetic field (information) stored on tape and disk media.</note>
    <note audience="audience-tech">Theoretically, data deletion is possible on some RW-capable media.
      For simplicity,
      however,
      the safer assumption is that rewriting and therefore data deletion is not possible on optical media.</note>
    <p>Owners of the data storage devices are responsible for procuring services that meet the necessary destruction outcomes as described previously.</p>
    <p>Wherever possible and appropriate,
      managers should pool together equipment with that of local colleagues to share service costs.</p>

      <body>
        <p>As part of the physical media or data destruction by the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> or its suppliers,
          validation of destruction <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/policyshall"/> be carried out.
          This is to ensure that data handling processes align with the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>
          Asset Management Lifecycle policies.
          This includes:
          <ol>
            <li>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> or supplier scans the hard drive or physical media asset tags or barcodes.</li>
            <li>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> or supplier carries out data destruction (as per the previous table).</li>
            <li>The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> or supplier confirms hard drive or physical media data destruction
              by providing reasonable proof.
            This can include:
          <ol>
            <li>Providing an inventory of physical media in their possession.</li>
            <li>Reconciliation carried out on the physical media scanned/received matching the physical media destroyed.</li>
            <li>A witness in attendance to sign a destruction certificate that is be stored in a secure space or network share.</li>
          </ol></li>

          <note>An alternative to the previous steps is to use a leading enterprise erasure tool that provides a certificate aligned to
