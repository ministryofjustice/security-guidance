	<title>Accessing <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems from overseas</title>
	<body>
		<p>This guidance information applies to all staff, contractors and agency staff who work for the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/mojlong"/>.</p>
		<note importance="high">If you are national security cleared to SC or DV levels, or subject to STRAP briefing, follow this process for all your trips, regardless of whether they are for business or personal reasons.</note>
		<p>As a government official travelling overseas, you should consider that you may be of interest to hostile parties regardless of your role. By following <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> policies and processes, you can help reduce the risk to yourself and limit the damage of exposure of sensitive information.</p>
		<p>Essential guidance is provided in the overseas travel information available from <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/securityemailtext"/>.</p>
		<!--
		<p>Additional guidance is provided on the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> Intranet, regarding <xref href="https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/emergencies/coronavirus-guidance/working-remotely/working-remotely-overseas/" format="html" scope="external">working remotely overseas</xref>.</p> -->
		<p>In general, it is acceptable for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> users to access <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> services from overseas, and to do this using their <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment. But before you travel, consider:
			<ul>
				<li><p>Do you need to take <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT equipment overseas or access <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> IT systems to do your job?</p></li>
				<li><p>Can the business need be met in another way or by someone else?</p></li>
				<li><p>If you just need to manage your inbox while away, can you delegate permissions to your inbox to a colleague to manage on your behalf?</p></li>
				<li><p>Have you left enough time to check and obtain necessary approvals? You should ensure that your request is submitted using the Overseas Travel Form available from <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/securityemailtext"/>, a minimum of fifteen working days before you intend to travel, or if you are subject to STRAP briefing a minimum of twenty working days before you intend to travel. This is because it may be necessary to apply additional technical controls to protect you, your devices, and any data the devices can access.</p></li>

				<p>When you return from your trip, you might need to attend a debrief with your line manager or security representative. The purpose of the meeting is to review events and identify anything that needs further attention or action from a security perspective.</p>
				<p>In addition to confirming the dates and countries visited, the debrief asks questions such as:
					<ul>
						<li>Did you have any problems arriving at or departing from each country visited?</li>
						<li>Did you have any unusual experiences while travelling, for example actual or suspected surveillance, customs inspections, or removal or disturbance of property?</li>
						<li>Did you have to make any changes to your planned travel arrangements?</li>
						<li>Were you asked unusual or detailed questions about your role, your work, or the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>?</li>
						<li>Were there any attempts to bribe, influence, or in some way compromise you, your family, or your colleagues?</li>
						<li>Were you invited to make or maintain on-going contact with a foreign national?</li>
						<li>Were you the victim of any criminal act, or detained or arrested?</li>
						<li>Did you lose or misplace any official material or personal items?</li>
						<li>Did you require medical treatment or legal assistance during your travel?</li>
						<li>Were there any technical difficulties during your travel?</li>

		<body>
			<p>While travelling, you might incur roaming charges when using your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment for calls or accessing services. These charges must be paid by your Business Unit. This is another reason for having a good business need to take <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment overseas.</p>
			<p>By default, <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment is not enabled for use overseas. Before travelling, request the ServiceNow Catalogue item for International Roaming, and the remote wipe function. This helps protect the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment in case of loss or theft.</p>
			<note>International Roaming can be found on <xref href="https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp/?id=home" format="html" scope="external">Service Now</xref> using:

		<title>If you have any problem when using <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment overseas</title>
		<body>
			<p>Contact the <xref href="#contacts" format="dita"><ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/servicedesk"/></xref> immediately. Tell them if the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment is lost, stolen, or was potentially compromised. This includes any time the equipment is deliberately removed out of your sight, such as by a customs official.</p>
			<p>If any security-related incident occurs overseas, regardless of whether it involves <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment, you should contact <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/securityemail"/> as soon as possible. Refer to the following <xref href="#contacts" format="dita">Contacts</xref> section, and the guidance on <xref href="reporting-an-incident.dita" format="dita">Reporting a security incident</xref>. This includes information on reporting an incident outside of UK working hours. For convenience, the out-of-hours telephone number for reporting incidents is repeated <xref href="#information-incident-reporting-line" format="dita">in this guidance</xref>.</p>
			<p>If there is a problem with your <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment, it might be necessary to disable your ability to connect to the <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> network or services from your device. The <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/servicedesk"/> will do this if required. <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/>-issued phones might still have some functionality, to let you make phone calls, but the device should be treated as compromised and not used any more for any <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> business.</p>
			<note>Do not be tempted to use non-<ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment for <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> business purposes. If you are having problems with <ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> equipment, you might wonder about using non-<ph conref="conrefs.dita#conrefs/moj"/> devices to carry out a particularly important task, or to respond to an urgent email. This is not <xref href="acceptable-use.dita" format="dita" platform="html">acceptable</xref><xref href="https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/acceptable-use/" format="html" scope="external" platform="epub pdf">acceptable</xref>.</note>
