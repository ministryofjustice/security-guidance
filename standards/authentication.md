# Authentication

## The base principle

Any access to any data **must** employ adequate authentication techniques to identify the system or user to a suitable level of confidence for the system or data within.

## Passwords

Where appropriate, passwords should be used as a knowledge-based factor for authentication.

MOJ has published the [MOJ Password Standard](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/itpolicycontent/blob/master/content/security/framework/password-standard.md) and accompanying [password guidance](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/itpolicycontent/blob/master/content/security/framework/password-guidance.md).

## Named individual accounts

Human user access must have unique, named and private accounts issued (with shared accounts being a rare, intentional and considered exception to this rule).

For example: Jonathan Bloggs is issued with a user account only Jonathan uses and may access.

### Account sharing

Accounts must not be shared unless they are defined as shared accounts, where additional authentication and authorisation techniques may be required.

For example:

- individuals must not share a 'root' account, but be issued named accounts with appropriate privileges instead;
- Individuals must not share a single Secure Shell (SSH) private key, but generate private and individual keypairs and their public key associated to locations where authentication is required.

## System-system accounts

Accounts designed for programmatic or system/service integation must be unique for each purpose, particularly in separation between different environments - such as pre-production and production.

System-system accounts must be protected against human intervention.

Token-based methods are preferred over static private key methods.

## Multi-factor Authentication

Where appropriate, multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be used as a knowledge-based factor for authentication.MFA is sometimes referred to as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

The MOJ published [MOJ Password Standard](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/itpolicycontent/blob/master/content/security/framework/password-standard.md) and accompanying [password guidance](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/itpolicycontent/blob/master/content/security/framework/password-guidance.md) discuss MFA in more detail.

### MFA is better than no MFA

The MOJ has an order of preference for MFA.

1. Hardware-based (for example,  Yubikeys)
2. Software-based (for example, [Google Prompt](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6361026?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en) on a mobile device)
3. [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm)-based (the code is held by a dedicated app such as Google Authenticator on a mobile device)
4. TOTP-based (the code is held within a multi-purpose app, for example, a password manager app that also holds other factor information)
5. SMS-based (a one-time code sent via SMS)
6. Email-based (a one-time code/link sent to the registered on-file email address)
7. No MFA at all

### MFA for Administrators

Administrative accounts **must** always have MFA, and have techniques in-place to ensure it is always enabled and active for each account.

### MFA for important or privileged actions

MFA should be re-requested from the user for important or privileged actions such as changing fundemental configurations such as registered email address or adding another administrator.

MFA can also be used as a validation step, to ensure the user understands and is confirming the action they have requested, such as an MFA re-prompt when attempting to delete data.

## IP addresses

### Trusting IP addresses

IP addresses in and of themselves do not constitute authentication but may be considered a minor authentication *indicator* when combined with other authentication and authorisation techniques.

For example, traffic originating from a perceived known IP address/range does not automatically mean it is the perceived user(s) however it could be used as an indicator to *reduce* (not eliminate) how often MFA is requested *within* an existing session.

### IP address for non-production systems

IP addresses access control lists (and/or techniques such as HTTP basic authentication) should be used to restrict access to non-production systems you do not wish general users to access.
