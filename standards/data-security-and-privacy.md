# Data Security & Privacy

## The base principle

All projects in development **must** follow the [MOJ Data Security and Privacy checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QPboirPbG0Db_sT4hq_VP4Vs4AiHSFLimLXlteXw2qQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Keeping track

Projects should 'test' themselves against the data security and privacy standards at project milestones (stage gates), and during project triage.

These tests ensure that the project follows the checklist consistently and continuously.

A overview of what to do as the project progresses can be found in the 'guides' section of this security guidance microsite.
