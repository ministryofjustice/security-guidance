# Using 1Password

## What is 1Password?

1Password is an online password management tool that we make available to you to help you create, store and share passwords. Using it means you no longer need to remember dozens of passwords, just a single primary password. It keeps all your website logins protected, helps with creating new 'strong' passwords and password sharing when required.

1Password is available as a browser extension for popular browsers, as well as a full software suite \(for use outside of browsers\) for Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS.

1Password securely saves your credentials in your own 'Vault' and then offers to autofill those credentials the next time you need them.

The has the Business tier of 1Password.

### Who should use it?

Currently, 1Password accounts can be requested by service or operations teams that have a need for shared passwords.

## How to get it

Contact the to request access.

Make sure you include in your message:

-   which team you're in
-   your role in your team
-   why you need access

### What it can be used for

1Password can be used for sharing passwords within a team, when individual named accounts cannot be created in the service. A good example is running a shared Twitter account.

**Note:** If you have a business need for a shared Twitter account, consider using a more enterprise-orientated tool for social media posting, such as [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) or [Hootsuite](https://www.hootsuite.com/). You need [formal approval](general-user-video-and-messaging-apps-guidance.md) to use tools like these.

#### Personal use

You use your 1Password account to store personal non-work information as it is a work account belonging to the . You may lose access if you change role. You will lose access entirely if you leave the .

Operations Engineering cannot routinely access the contents of vaults but can reset accounts to gain access if there is a good reason to do so.

### What it shouldn't be used for

1Password be used for storing personal passwords, or for storing documents. Use existing approved services such as Office 365 or for storing documents.

You use 1Password for 'secrets' that belong to systems, only credentials to be used by humans. There is separate guidance on how to handle system [secrets](secrets-management.md).

## How to use it

### Getting started

You will be sent an email to your work email account inviting you to create your account. 1Password have ['getting started' guides](https://support.1password.com/explore/get-started/) on their website.

#### Creating your primary password

You need to create a primary password - this is the only password you'll need to remember.

It be at least 14 characters long \(the longer the better\).

You can choose to make it pronounceable and memorable \(passphrase\) such as `CyberSecurityRules!` or `Sup3rD00p3rc0Mp3X!`, as long as you're comfortable remembering it and won't need to write it down.

There are password guidance standards [here](passwords.md).

Your primary password be unique and you use it anywhere else \(including a similar version, for example, by simply adding numbers to the end\)

#### Multi-Factor Authentication

You setup multi-factor authentication \(MFA, sometimes known as 2FA\) for your account.

1Password has a [guide on setting up MFA](https://support.1password.com/two-factor-authentication/).

The has an 'order of preference' for [which types of MFA to use](authentication.md):

-   Hardware-based \(for example, Yubikeys\)
-   Software-based \(for example, Google Prompt on a mobile device\)
-   TOTP-based \(the code is held by a dedicated app such as Google or LastPass Authenticator on a mobile device\)
-   SMS-based \(a one-time code sent via SMS\)

If you don't have an -issued work smartphone you may use a personal device for MFA.

### Sharing passwords

To share a password, create a [Vault](https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults/).

You make sure the credentials you're sharing are only available to the people who need to access them for work. It is your responsibility to remove items or people from vaults when access to the credential\(s\) is no longer required.

You share your 1Password main password with anyone, even your line manager or security.

### Using it overseas

Taking a device \(such as personal smartphone\) that has 1Password installed counts as travelling overseas with information.

The has existing [policies on travelling abroad on the intranet](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/staff-security-and-responsibilities/travelling-abroad-business-or-personal/), which require various approvals before travel.

It may be simpler to 'log out' of the 1Password applications or enable [Travel Mode](https://support.1password.com/travel-mode/) to remove vaults from your devices. These can be reinstated when you return to the UK.

### Keeping 1Password update to date

Like all software, it is important to keep the software up to date \(sometimes known as 'patching'\). 1Password software generally self-updates to the latest version by itself, however make sure you approve or apply any updates if 1Password asks you to.
