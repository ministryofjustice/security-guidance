# Training and Education

## Why?

The Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\)'s Information Security awareness programme plays an essential part in maintaining security. It informs all MoJ staff of:

-   Their duties with regard to security.
-   Their responsibilities to protect the assets \(information, equipment, people and buildings\) they have access to and use.
-   The importance of reporting any actual or suspected security incidents.

Guidance is provided to staff via the Security section of the MoJ Intranet, [https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/). All new staff starting work within the MoJ will receive mandatory IA training. This should ensure that the new staff member is made aware of their security responsibilities whilst working at the MoJ.
