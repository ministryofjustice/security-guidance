# Cyber and Technical Security Guidance

## Summary

This site documents some of the security decisions that the [Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice) has made for the products we operate, and our relationships with suppliers.

The MoJ [Technical Guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/) covers technical decisions in the MoJ more widely.

**Note:** This guidance is dated: 19 October 2022.

### Security culture

In addition to the obvious security resources such as policies, controls, and software and hardware tools, all organisations need employees, suppliers and other colleagues to behave in a way that helps ensure good security at all times. A simple example is where someone will act in a way that maintains good security, even if they don't know exactly what the formal process is. The extent to which an organisation has good security in indicated by its security culture.

Security culture refers to the set of values, shared by everyone in an organisation, that determines how people are expected to think about and approach security. Getting security culture right helps develop a security conscious workforce, and promotes the desired security behaviours expected from everyone working in or for the organisation.​

The MoJ is creating a portfolio of security culture resources to help supplement the formal policy and guidance material. Initial security culture material is available for preview [here](security-culture.md).

### Getting in touch

-   [To report an incident](reporting-an-incident.md).
-   For general assistance on MoJ security matters, email [security@justice.gov.uk](mailto:security@justice.gov.uk).
-   For Cyber Security assistance or consulting, email [security@justice.gov.uk](mailto:security@justice.gov.uk). More information about the Security Team is [available](user-guide.md).
-   Suppliers to the MoJ should first communicate with their usual MoJ points of contact.

### Background

[Government Functional Standard - GovS 007: Security](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-007-security) replaces the [HMG Security Policy Framework \(SPF\)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/security-policy-framework). The policies which sit within that framework remain in effect, but are now in support of this standard.

![A diagram showing a hierarchy of the key components within the Government Functional Standard. It is in three sections. In the first section, at the top is a triangle labelled Principles. This stands on a block marked Content, which itself stands on a block marked Governance, showing that governance and content underpin the principles. The second section is called Security Life Cycle. It shows a flow from left to right. To the left of the section is a large arrow entitled Security Strategy and Planning. This arrow splits on the right hand side into two small arrows. The top small arrow is labelled Prevention and Detection. The bottom small arrow is labelled Security Incident Management. A small line arrow drops down from the top Prevention and Detection arrow to the bottom Security Incident Management arrow. To the right hand side of this section of the diagram, the Prevention and Detection and the Security Incident Management arrows converge into a final large arrow, entitled Review and Learn from Experience. A dotted line arrow, labelled Improvement, goes back from the Review and Learn arrow over to the beginning of this section of the diagram, linking to the Security Strategy and Planning arrow. Underneath these arrow diagrams is the third and final section. This is a summary text, called Security Practices. Many practices are listed using three columns in this section. The left column list includes: Critical Assets and Services, Risk Management, and Access to information. The middle column list includes: Capability, capacity and resources, Security culture, Security education and awareness, and Physical security. The right column list includes: Personnel security, Cyber security, and Technical security.](images/gov007overview.png)

Sections 6.3 Cyber security and 6.4 Technical security of the standard state:

-   > The purpose of cyber security is to ensure the security of data and information. To operate effectively, the UK government needs to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its information, systems and infrastructure, and the services it provides.
-   > The purpose of technical security measures is to holistically protect sensitive information and technology from close access acquisition or exploitation by hostile actors, as well as any other form of technical manipulation. Technical security also relates to the protection of security systems from compromise and/or external interference.
