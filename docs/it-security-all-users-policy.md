# IT Security All Users Policy

**Parent topic:** [IT Security Policy \(Overview\)](it-security-policy-overview.md)

## Introduction

This policy provides more information on the actions expected of all Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\) users when using MoJ equipment and infrastructure. It is a sub-page to the [IT Security Policy Overview](it-security-policy-overview.md).

**Note:** In this document, the terms "data" and "information" are used interchangeably.

## Audience

This policy is aimed at three audiences:

<a name="technical-users"></a>

-   **Technical users**

    These are in-house MoJ Digital and Technology staff who are responsible for implementing controls throughout technical design, development, system integration, and operation. This includes DevOps, Software Developers, Technical Architects, and Service Owners. It also includes Incident Managers from the Event, Problem, Incident, CSI and Knowledge \(EPICK\) Team.

<a name="service-providers"></a>

-   **Service Providers**

    Defined as any other MoJ business group, agency, contractor, IT supplier and partner who in any way designs, develops or supplies services \(including processing, transmitting and storing data\) for, or on behalf of, the MoJ.

<a name="general-users"></a>

-   **General users**

    All other staff working for the MoJ.


Within this policy, "all MoJ users" refers to General users, Technical users, and Service Providers as defined previously.

## Approach

The MoJ ensures that IT security controls are designed and implemented to protect MoJ data, IT Assets, and reputation, based around the following requirements:

<a name="confidentiality"></a>

-   **Confidentiality**

    Knowing and ensuring that data can only be accessed by those authorised to do so.

<a name="integrity"></a>

-   **Integrity**

    Knowing and ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data, and that it has not been deliberately or inadvertently modified from a previous version.

<a name="availability"></a>

-   **Availability**

    Knowing and ensuring that IT systems and data can always be accessed when required and authorised.


## Assets

This policy applies to all premises, physical equipment, software and data owned or managed by the MoJ. This includes IT systems, whether developed by the MoJ or managed by IT service providers. It covers the use of IT equipment and the data processed on those IT systems, irrespective of location. It provides direction and support to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of MoJ resources.

## Security classification

All MoJ Staff are responsible for ensuring data is:

-   Classified correctly as detailed in the [Information Classification, Handling and Security Guide](information-classification-handling-and-security-guide.md)
-   Distributed only in accordance with the statements of this policy and related guides.
-   Protected by the appropriate security controls to ensure its confidentiality, integrity and availability.

Access to classified information shall be controlled in accordance with the requirements set out within the MoJ [Access Control Guide](access-control-guide.md).

## Physical and personnel security

The Physical Security Policy defines how physical access to assets must be controlled within the MoJ to prevent unauthorised access, use, modification, loss, or damage. All MoJ users must understand that:

-   All MoJ IT systems and services must be assessed against environmental risks, for example flood or fire, to maintain the asset's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
-   The MoJ's IT Teams are not directly responsible for the physical security and environment of the MoJ sites.
-   Physical security controls and the environment in which the MoJ IT systems operate form part of a system's overall risk landscape. All MoJ users **shall** ensure they adhere to the security controls and requirements set out in this policy.
-   Unless otherwise formally agreed by the MoJ, all MoJ users, including agency staff and contractors who have access to MoJ data, require [Baseline Personnel Security Standard \(BPSS\)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-baseline-personnel-security-standard) assessment, as a minimum.
-   [National Security Vetting](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/security-vetting-and-clearance#applicant) should only be applied for where it is necessary, proportionate, and adds real value.
-   The MoJ does not have a standing requirement for system administrators or application developers to maintain Security Check \(SC\) clearance.

Further information on physical and personnel security is available from [Security team](mailto:security@justice.gov.uk) and [CPNI Guidance](https://www.cpni.gov.uk/physical-security).

## Identity and access control

The MoJ [Access Control Guide](access-control-guide.md) ensures that information and IT assets can be accessed only by authorised personnel, and that each individual is accountable for their actions.

The guide outlines the controls and processes designed to limit access based on a "need to know" basis, and according to defined roles and responsibilities.

The MoJ [Access Control Guide](access-control-guide.md) addresses access control principles such as identification, authentication, authorisation, and accounting.

## Password management

The MoJ [Password Management Guide](password-management-guide.md) sets out the requirements for strong password implementation and management, to help prevent unauthorised access to MoJ systems. Examples include password creation, authentication, storage and management.

## Email security

The MoJ [Email guidance](email.md) tells you about safe and secure use of email within the MoJ.

The more detailed MoJ [Email Security Guide](email-security-guide.md) specifies the controls and processes required to protect the MoJ's email systems from unauthorised access or misuse, that may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the data stored and shared within them.

The guide outlines the various security levels required to transfer information from the MoJ's email servers to organisations outside the MoJ and other government departments. It covers topics such as the threats to email security \(phishing\) and secure email transfer.

## Remote working and portable devices

The MoJ has in place [Remote Working](remote-working.md) guidance that sets out the requirements for safely accessing and using the MoJ's systems and applications when working remotely, for example from home, another government office, or while travelling.

Mobile computing is the use of portable equipment such as mobile phone, laptop or tablet, and which supports remote working. Mobile computing equipment provided by the MoJ must be used in line with the [Acceptable Use Policy](acceptable-use-policy.md).

Any request to take MoJ IT equipment overseas must follow the guidance provided in the [Acceptable Use Policy](acceptable-use-policy.md) and the [Accessing MoJ IT Systems From Overseas](accessing-moj-it-systems-from-overseas.md) information.

## Malware protection

The MoJ [Malware Protection Guide](malware-protection-guide-introduction.md) specifies the controls and processes that **shall** be used to protect all systems against malware. Malware might enter the MoJ by employee email, through the internet, mobile computers, or removable media devices.

The MoJ [Malware Protection Guide](malware-protection-guide-introduction.md) addresses the following relevant domains:

-   Implementation controls to stop malware entering MoJ devices and systems.
-   Preventing malicious code from executing on MoJ devices and systems.
-   Mitigating the impact of malware when entering MoJ devices and systems.

## Roles and responsibilities
