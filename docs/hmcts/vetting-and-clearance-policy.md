Introduction
============

This Policy details the responsibilities and obligations placed upon
HMCTS staff, contractors, and sub-contractors with respect to vetting
and clearance.

HMCTS deals with information the vast bulk of which is classified as
OFFICIAL with some information assets given the additional caveat of
OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE.

Purpose
=======

This document defines requirements governing the vetting and clearance
of all persons working in or for HMCTS.

Scope
=====

This Policy applies to all parties accessing HMCTS data, information or
systems.

Roles and Responsibilities
==========================

**The Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO)** is responsible for issuing
waivers to these requirements where necessary; this can only be done by
accepting the residual risk as determined in a risk balance case.

**HMCTS line managers or contract managers** are responsible for
determining the need for any role to require national security vetting
(NSV).

**Individual members of HMCTS staff, contractors and sub-contractors**
are responsible for notifying their line management of any relevant
change of circumstance.

**HMCTS Security staff** are responsible for the continual monitoring
and enforcement of this policy

Policy Statements
=================

Basic Vetting
-------------

All persons working in or for HMCTS **must** have successfully completed
Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) vetting before being granted
access to HMCTS information.

Access to OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE Information
----------------------------------------

Access to OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE does not require vetting to above BPSS as a
rule.

Where individuals are required to access and/or work with
OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE information strict need to know controls **must** be
enforced and the persons concerned should receive extra awareness
training.

National Security Vetting
-------------------------

Certain activities involving information classified OFFICIAL present an
enhanced information security threat and it has been determined that one
of the security controls applicable in these cases is that NSV to
Security Check (SC) status is required.

Personnel undertaking the following activities **must** be cleared to
SC:

-   Crafting or modifying code for applications which are crucial to the
    work of the department.

-   Accessing personal data in bulk.

-   Possessing administrative privileges with the ability to adversely
    impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of services.

-   Influencing any aspect of the design or implementation of security
    enforcing functions.

-   Has long term, regular, unsupervised access to data centres or
    communications rooms.

-   Has regular privileged unsupervised and unconstrained access to
    systems which contain data for multiple MoJ systems, for example
    backups, or console access to multiple cloud services.

-   Has cryptography responsibilities and handling, under advice from
    the Crypto Custodian.

-   Has access to multiple system security testing outcomes which reveal
    vulnerabilities in live services.

-   Has a role such as system support or IT investigation role, such
    that without further authority or authorisation, an individual
    might:

    -   Act as another user.

    -   Elevate the privileges of a user.

    -   Obtain credentials for another user.

    -   Directly access other users’ data.

SC is also required if there is access to information classified SECRET
which is long-term, frequent and uncontrolled, or sufficient to form a
comprehensive picture of a policy, plan or project.

Direct Vetting (DV) is required if there is access to information
classified TOP SECRET which is long-term, frequent and uncontrolled, or
sufficient to form a comprehensive picture of a policy, plan or project.

SC is not routinely available to non-UK nationals and DV is only
available to UK nationals.

Waivers
-------

If a waiver to any of the requirements of this policy is needed for
operational reasons, then the individual requiring the waiver **must**
make a risk balance case. For the waiver to be granted the risk balance
case **must** be signed off by the SIRO or by someone to whom the SIRO
has delegated the authority.

Review and Maintenance
======================

Policies are subject to annual review with approval and authorisation
from the HMCTS deputy SIRO. HMCTS Security and Information Assurance
teams are responsible for on-going policy maintenance.
