# Introduction

This Policy details the responsibilities and obligations placed upon HMCTS staff, contractors, and sub-contractors with respect to vetting and clearance.

HMCTS deals with information the vast bulk of which is classified as OFFICIAL with some information assets given the additional caveat of OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE.

# Purpose

This document defines requirements governing the vetting and clearance of all persons working in or for HMCTS.

# Scope

This Policy applies to all parties accessing HMCTS data, information or systems.

# Roles and Responsibilities

**The Senior Information Risk Owner \(SIRO\)** is responsible for issuing waivers to these requirements where necessary; this can only be done by accepting the residual risk as determined in a risk balance case.

**HMCTS line managers or contract managers** are responsible for determining the need for any role to require national security vetting \(NSV\).

**Individual members of HMCTS staff, contractors and sub-contractors** are responsible for notifying their line management of any relevant change of circumstance.

**HMCTS Security staff** are responsible for the continual monitoring and enforcement of this policy

# Policy Statements

## Basic Vetting

All persons working in or for HMCTS **must** have successfully completed Baseline Personnel Security Standard \(BPSS\) vetting before being granted access to HMCTS information.

## Access to OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE Information

Access to OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE does not require vetting to above BPSS as a rule.

Where individuals are required to access and/or work with OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE information strict need to know controls **must** be enforced and the persons concerned should receive extra awareness training.

## National Security Vetting

Certain activities involving information classified OFFICIAL present an enhanced information security threat and it has been determined that one of the security controls applicable in these cases is that NSV to Security Check \(SC\) status is required.

Personnel undertaking the following activities **must** be cleared to SC:

-   Crafting or modifying code for applications which are crucial to the work of the department.

-   Accessing personal data in bulk.

-   Possessing administrative privileges with the ability to adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of services.

-   Influencing any aspect of the design or implementation of security enforcing functions.

-   Has long term, regular, unsupervised access to data centres or communications rooms.

-   Has regular privileged unsupervised and unconstrained access to systems which contain data for multiple MoJ systems, for example backups, or console access to multiple cloud services.

-   Has cryptography responsibilities and handling, under advice from the Crypto Custodian.

-   Has access to multiple system security testing outcomes which reveal vulnerabilities in live services.

-   Has a role such as system support or IT investigation role, such that without further authority or authorisation, an individual might:

    -   Act as another user.

    -   Elevate the privileges of a user.

    -   Obtain credentials for another user.

    -   Directly access other users’ data.


SC is also required if there is access to information classified SECRET which is long-term, frequent and uncontrolled, or sufficient to form a comprehensive picture of a policy, plan or project.

Direct Vetting \(DV\) is required if there is access to information classified TOP SECRET which is long-term, frequent and uncontrolled, or sufficient to form a comprehensive picture of a policy, plan or project.

SC is not routinely available to non-UK nationals and DV is only available to UK nationals.

## Waivers

If a waiver to any of the requirements of this policy is needed for operational reasons, then the individual requiring the waiver **must** make a risk balance case. For the waiver to be granted the risk balance case **must** be signed off by the SIRO or by someone to whom the SIRO has delegated the authority.

# Review and Maintenance

Policies are subject to annual review with approval and authorisation from the HMCTS deputy SIRO. HMCTS Security and Information Assurance teams are responsible for on-going policy maintenance.
