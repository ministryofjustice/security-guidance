# Accounting

## The base principle

Any access, and subsequent activity, to any system or data **must** employ adequate accounting techniques to ensure events can be attributed to the authenticated entity.

Accounting information must be stored in a way that it cannot be readily manipulated, particularly by the authenticated entity.

## Log data security &amp; governance

Log data can include Personal Data or inadvertent sensitive data \(when an application or system is unexpectedly verbose\) and must be adequately protected and governed in a comparable way to the original system's data.

## Security-related log data retention

Log data created and processed for information security purposes should be retained for no longer than 2 \(two\) years by default \(this is subject to any legislative or regulative compliance requirements\) but for a minimum of 6 months.

These times are general as a guide, and require contextual analysis particularly where Personal Data is involved.
