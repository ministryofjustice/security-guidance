# Handling instructions guidance

The [HMG Security Classifications Policy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) outlines HMG's administrative framework to facilitate the secure, timely, and efficient exchange of information. It mandates that all HMG information be marked according to a specific classification tier, and given any required handling instructions.

This guidance on handling instructions has been developed to aid users in adhering to this requirement, providing examples of how the labelling system and handling descriptors can be applied effectively.

## Handling and securing information

Within a classification tier, handling instructions can also be used to give a more detailed picture of the information's sensitivity and how it should be appropriately handled.

Handling instructions do not change the information's classification as the threat profile is the same, nor do they offer additional technical protections; they just provide more detail around how information should be handled, how widely it should be disseminated and how it should be protected.

A centrally defined list of handling instructions is shown in the Additional Markings section of the Government Security Classifications Policy.

Different information security measures might be applicable throughout the information lifecycle. It is important continually to evaluate security classifications and their corresponding measures. Refer to the [HMG Security Classifications Policy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) for further guidance.

## Additional markings

Additional markings can be added in conjunction with a classification to indicate the nature or source of the information, or to limit access to specific user groups.

Additional markings indicate where additional protective controls or security behaviours are required to protect the information. There are several different types of additional markings, including:

-   the -SENSITIVE marking
-   handling instructions
-   descriptors

Information creators should apply additional markings to help users understand information sensitivities and specific restrictions on information sharing.

Security teams must offer guidance to users on how to mark and protect information with additional markings.

The [HMG Security Classifications Policy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) gives more information about additional markings.

## Guidance on handling instructions

### OFFICIAL

**Label**: OFFICIAL

Description: This category applies to most information that is created, processed, sent, or received within the public sector and by partner organisations. It encompasses data that, if compromised, could result in no more than moderate damage.

It includes cleared for publication, already public domain, or set to be released under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 \(FOIA\) or the Public Records Act 1958. It is characterised by low sensitivity and a recognised need-to-share with the wider public.

### OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE

**Label**: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE

Description: This category is for particularly sensitive information that poses high compromise risks. The “SENSITIVE” marking is used for OFFICIAL information nor meant for public release, attracting interest from potential threat actors, activists, or media.

General example: Data on staff turnover and recruitment challenges, which might indicate vulnerabilities if disclosed.

Operational example: Incident reports detailing specific breaches of data or security within the MoJ, including impact analyses.

**Label**: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE - HMG USE ONLY

Description: Information that should only be shared with other HMG departments; not with external partners.

General example: Policy discussion papers circulated for feedback among various HMG departments prior to finalisation.

Operational example: A briefing note on proposed legislative changes affecting multiple departments, for internal discussion before public consultation.

**Label**: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE- MOJ USE ONLY

Description: The information is intended solely for internal distribution within the MoJ. External sharing requires authorisation from the information's originator MoJ.

**Label**: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE - EMBARGOED

General example: A publicly available research paper on criminal justice reform authored by an independent think tank. This document is accessible online without any restrictions and can be freely shared or referenced by anyone interested in the topic.

Operational example: A schedule of public court hearings and trials posted on official court websites. This information is intended for the public to know about and attend court sessions, ensuring transparency and openness in the judicial process.
