# Long format appendix

The current draft of the MOJ commodity long format data destruction appendix. The appendix is a dependancy of the long format clause itself.

`Highlighted` words indicate potential requirement for contextual change, requirement of definition and so on.

## Appendix

The following standards and guidelines are the *minimum* basis for data decommissioning or destruction. Follow and apply them as appropriate. There might also be extra steps specific to a data set or system.

- National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) guidance on end-user device reset procedures: <https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/end-user-device-guidance-factory-reset-and-reprovisioning>
- NCSC guidance on secure sanitisation of storage media: <https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/secure-sanitisation-storage-media>
- NCSC Cloud Security Principle 2: Asset Protection and Resilience (Data Destruction): <https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/cloud-security-principle-2-asset-protection-and-resilience#sanitisation>
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (Data Destruction): <https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org>
- DIN: <http://www.din-66399.com/index.php/en/securitylevels>

Data Destruction for electronic/magnetic storage **must** include, unless otherwise superseded by NCSC, PCI-DSS or specific `Authority` guidance:

- the revocation or otherwise destruction of decryption keys and/or mechanisms to render data inaccessible or otherwise void through the use of modern cryptography; AND/OR
- data overwriting methods consisting of at least 3 (three) complete overwrite passes of random data.

Data Destruction for printed materials **must** include, unless otherwise superseded by NCSC or specific `Authority` guidance:

- paper cross-shredding methods to satisfy at least the DIN 66399 Level
4 standard with a maximum cross cut particle surface area 160 (one
hundred and sixty) millimeters squared with a maximum strip width of
6 (six) millimeters

The required outcome is to ensure that `Authority` data is inaccessible by any reasonable commercial and resourced means (such as commercially available data recovery services).
