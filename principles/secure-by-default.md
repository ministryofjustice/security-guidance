# Secure by Default

We believe that technology should be Secure by Default: embedding security from inception so it is native and as transparent as possible.

### Good technical design is security design

Secure by Default is taking a holistic approach to solving security problems as a core tenant rather than a followup activity.

Embedding security within a design is directly comparable to good modern technical designs and fundementally ensuring the 'thing' actually works.

### Secure by Default

The [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk) prescribe the Secure by Default principles as: 

- security should be built into products from the beginning, it can’t be added in later;
- security should be added to treat the root cause of a problem, not its symptoms;
- security is never a goal in and of itself, it is a process – and it must continue throughout the lifetime of the product;
- security should never compromise usability – products need to be secure enough, then maximise usability;
- security should not require extensive configuration to work, and should just work reliably where implemented;
- security should constantly evolve to meet and defeat the latest threats – new security features should take longer to defeat than they take to build;
- security through obscurity should be avoided;
- security should not require specific technical understanding or non-obvious behaviour from the user.

### Context is important
The principles above can generally be applied in most scenarios however interpretation and applicability in context can vary - the MOJ Cybersecurity team are here to help and advise.

NCSC also have a set of whitepapers which help explain some approaches to building products which align with these principles (and they add to them over time):

- [Building a secure feature-rich computing platform](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/articles/secure-default-platforms), such as a smartphone.
- [Storing sensitive data on consumer platforms](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/articles/sensitive-data-consumer-platforms)
