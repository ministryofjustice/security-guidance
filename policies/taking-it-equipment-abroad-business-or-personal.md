# Taking IT Equipment Abroad - Business or Personal travel

In general, it is acceptable for MOJ users to access MOJ services from abroad, and to do this using their MOJ equipment.

You must seek permission from your line manager and SCS/Governor first, and before you travel, consider:

* if you need to take MOJ IT equipment abroad or access MOJ IT systems to do your job?
* if the business need can be met in another way or by someone else?
* if you just need to manage your inbox while away, whether you can delegate permissions to your inbox to a colleague to manage on your behalf?

As a government official travelling overseas, you should consider that you may be of interest to hostile parties regardless of your role. By following MOJ policies and processes, you can help reduce the risk to yourself and limit the damage of exposure of sensitive information.

**Special case:** If you are national security cleared to ‘Enhanced SC’ or DV levels, you must also contact Corporate Security branch before travelling, regardless of whether the trip is for business or personal reasons.
 
If you are visiting or stopping over at one of the following countries you must still seek permission from your line manager and SCS/Governor, and if they approve, additionally submit your request to Operational Security giving at least 14 days’ notice. This is because it may be necessary to apply additional technical controls to protect you, your device, and any data they can access.
 
* China
* Cyprus
* Egypt
* France
* Germany
* India
* Iran
* Israel
* North Korea
* Pakistan
* Russia
* Saudi Arabia
* South Africa
* South Korea
* Syria
* Turkey
* UAE
 
## To make a request if visiting one of the countries listed above

First, collect the following information:

* name
* email address
* your security clearance
* network you use
* make/type of equipment you want to take with you
* asset tag details
* country of travel
* dates of travel
* proposed method of connecting (e.g. MOJ WiFi)
* reason for maintaining access while abroad

Next, request business approval as follows:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| MOJ HQ, HMPPS HQ or HMCTS MOJ staff | Send your request to your Senior Civil Servant (SCS) |
| All HMPPS staff except HQ | Send your request to your governor |


When you have received business approval, send a copy of your request and the approval to Operational Security:

> `OperationalSecurityTeam@justice.gov.uk`

When Operational Security have acknowledged receipt of the request and approval, the process is complete.

If you are a HMPPS staff member, you also need to send your approval to:

> `informationmgmtsecurity@noms.gsi.gov.uk`

## International Roaming

While travelling, you might incur roaming charges when using your MOJ equipment for calls or accessing services. These charges can be expensive, and must be paid by your Business Unit. This is another reason for having a good business need to take MOJ equipment abroad.

By default, MOJ equipment is not enabled for use abroad. Before travelling, contact the MOJ Phone and Mobile Devices team. Ask them to enable International Roaming, and to activate the remote wipe function. This protects the MOJ equipment in case of loss or theft.

**NOTE:** Remote wipe function is available by default on iPhones issued by the MoJ. On older phones using the Good Technology app for email access, remote wiping function is not available and you should consider whether to take your mobile abroad after discussing it with your line manager

## If you have any problem when using MOJ equipment abroad

Contact the Service Desk immediately. Tell them if the MOJ equipment is lost, stolen or was potentially compromised. This includes any time the equipment is deliberately removed out of your sight, such as by a customs official.

When calling from abroad, the Technology Service Desk number you need is:

> `+44 0800 917 5148`

If any security-related incident occurs overseas, you should contact the Duty Security Officer as soon as possible.

It might be necessary to disable your ability to connect to the MOJ network or services from your device. Service Desk will do this if required.

MOJ-issued phones might still have some functionality, to let you make phone calls, but the device should be treated as compromised and not used any more for any MOJ business.

## If you have any problem when using HMPPS equipment abroad

Contact the Incident Desk immediately on:

> `+44 203 788 4636`

Tell them if the HMPPS equipment is lost, stolen or was potentially compromised. This includes any time the equipment is deliberately removed out of your sight, such as by a customs official.
