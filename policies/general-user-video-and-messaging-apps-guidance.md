# General User Video and Messaging Apps Guidance

## Overview

When working from home, you still need to communicate with MOJ colleagues. You'll also need to work with people outside the MOJ. There are various tools you might use, besides the standard email and telephone tools.
This document tells you about the tools you can, and cannot, use for business purposes.
This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.

Some ALBs, Agencies, or other large groups within the MOJ might have their own, specific guidance regarding how to use certain Video and Messaging apps for different purposes.

### OFFICIAL and OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE Information

‘OFFICIAL’ information is the majority of information that is created or processed by the public sector. This includes routine business operations and services, some of which could have damaging consequences if lost, stolen or published in the media, but are not subject to a heightened threat profile.

‘OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE’ is not a classification. ‘Sensitive’ is a handling caveat for a small subset of information marked OFFICIAL that requires special handling by staff. You should apply the handling caveat where you wish to control access to that information, whether in a document, email etc.

### Access to tools

You can access tools that are provided through your MOJ provided devices by downloading from:

- For Dom1 equipment - through the Software Centre application on your device;
- For Digital Service Desk (DSD) managed Macbooks - through the Self Service application on your Mac.

Currently, access to the tools mentioned in this document is not available from Quantum devices.

For other MOJ provided devices, seek help from your Line Manager in the first instance.

### Corporate, work and personal accounts

- A corporate account is for making official MOJ statements and providing official views. Only a small number of authorised people can use it.
- A work account is your normal MOJ account, that you use every day for business as usual. Only you have access to your work account.
- A personal account is your own personal account on gmail, hotmail, yahoo, and so on. You should never use a personal account for business purposes.

Some of the applications listed make a distinction between general use with a work account, and use with a corporate account. Using a tool with a corporate account means you are providing views or statements on behalf of the MOJ. Never use a personal account for business purposes with any tool.

Remember that if you are authorised to use a corporate account, you are speaking and acting for the whole of the MOJ. When working with a personal account, you are speaking and acting as an MOJ employee and a civil servant.

Always follow all [MOJ policies and guidelines regarding public information, including social media (to access this information you'll need to be connected to the MOJ Intranet)](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2015/11/social-media-policy-guidance.pdf). In particular, follow the [Civil Service Code of Conduct](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code).

### Acceptable Use

You must use communications tools for business purposes in an acceptable way.

Be sensible when using communications tools for MOJ business purposes:

- Be extra careful with sensitive and personal information in tools.
- Try to avoid using the same tool for business and personal use - you can get confused who you're talking with.
- If the message you're about to send might cause problems, upset, offence, or embarrassment, it's not acceptable.
- Context is important - a message you might think is funny could be upsetting to someone else.
- If something goes wrong, report it.

The bottom line is: *"if there is doubt, there is no doubt - ask for help!".*
